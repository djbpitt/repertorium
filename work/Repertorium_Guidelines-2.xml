               <p>These Guidelines are the first complete introduction to the Repertorium Initiative
                  XML model for the electronic description of medieval manuscripts. The model is
                  part of the activity of the <emph>Special Commission for Computer Processing of
                     Medieval Slavonic Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</emph> to the Executive
                  Board of the International Committee of Slavists. This version of the Guidelines
                  differs significantly from all previous versions in both form and content. The
                  most important new feature is the synchronization with the “P5: Guidelines for
                  Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange” of the Text Encoding Initiative
                  Consortium (TEI) XML. We have retained differences between the TEI and the
                  Repertorium manuscript description models in situations where it was necessary to
                  extend the TEI resources, but we have made every effort to bring two as close as
                  possible, taking into consideration primarily the three principal medieval
                  manuscript traditions in Europe: Slavic, Greek, and Latin. We hope that the result
                  will contribute to further discussion of how to encode a manuscript description in
                  electronic form. An Appendix to this text explains and discusses remaining
                  differences between the TEI and Repertorium schemas and guidelines.</p>
               <p>This edition has been rewritten completely, and is not based directly on earlier
                  attempts to document the Repertorium XML model. It contains many editorial
                  changes, new examples, revised lists of elements and attributes, and discussions
                  about a wide variety of topics.</p>
               <p>Previous versions of these Guidelines circulated only in electronic form. The
                  first was compiled for the Annual TEI Members’ Meeting in 2005 in Sofia.
                  Subsequently, within the framework of the project <orgName>Slovo: Toward a Digital
                     Library of South Slavic Manuscripts</orgName> (2007–08, cf. Miklas &amp;
                  Miltenova 2008), funded by the Austrian Science and Liaison Offices, a new
                  electronic version was prepared. Both are now archived and available on request.
                  The present, new Guidelines are based on the ideas and proposals contained in
                  various project papers, proceedings and special volumes (Birnbaum &amp; Miltenova
                  2000, esp. Miltenova &amp; Bojadžiev 2000, Bojadžiev 2000, Dobreva 2000, Stojkova
                  2000, Radoslavova 2000; Miltenova et al. 2003, esp. Cleminson 2003, Bojadžiev et
                  al. 2003, Moussakova 2003, Krushelnitskaya 2003; Miklas &amp; Miltenova 2008, cf.
                  Birnbaum et. al. 1995; Cleminson 1998; Gagova 1998, 2000; Radoslavova 1998;
                  Stoykova 1998), as well as in the Commission’s journal
                  <title level="j">Scripta &amp; e-Scripta</title> (e.g., Miltenova 2008; Boyadzhiev
                  2009). These ideas have also been presented and discussed at several conferences
                  and workshops. It goes without saying that this published document can reflect
                  only the current level of our work and the model may undergo further changes, but
                  we consider the present version representative of a stable stage in the
                  development of the Repertorium schema that has been used effectively in
                  production.</p>

               <head>About this document</head>
               <p>This document is provided as an introduction to the XML model for the description
                  of Medieval Manuscripts known as the Repertorium Initiative or Template for Slavic
                  Manuscripts (TSM). It is intended for those who have some previous knowledge of
                  XML technologies and who would like to begin to describe medieval manuscripts. It
                  should not be considered a general introduction to markup technologies, nor a
                  tutorial on the TEI approach to linguistic and literary markup. For the latter,
                  see the fifth chapter of the current P5 edition of the TEI Guidelines
                  <title level="a">A gentle introduction to XML</title> (Burnard &amp; Bauman
                  2007).</p>

                  editing and proofreading various passages of the text, I owe special thanks to the
                  following for their patience and courage: David J. Birnbaum, Ralph Cleminson,

            <head>Introduction to the model</head>
            <div>
               <head>Short history</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative started during 1994–95 as <orgName>Computer-Supported
                     Processing of Medieval Slavic Manuscripts</orgName>, an international project
                  with coordinators Prof. David J. Birnbaum (University of Pittsburgh) and Dr.
                  Anisava Miltenova (Institute of Literature, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences). The
                  project was supported by a grant from the International Research and Exchanges
                  Board (IREX), Washington, DC. During this period an initial SGML model was
                  developed by David J. Birnbaum, Anisava Miltenova, Milena Dobreva (Institute of
                  Mathematics and Informatics, BAS, Bulgaria), Berend Dijk, and Harry Gaylord (both
                  from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands). Further work on defining
                  content models, especially for textological, linguistic and palaeographical
                  features, was implemented in 1995 by David J. Birnbaum, Anisava Miltenova, and
                  Andrej Bojadžiev.</p>
               <p>During the next three years (1996–98) the project continued as a joint initiative
                  under the guidance of Prof. Ralph Cleminson (Central European University
                  [Budapest, Hungary] and the University of Portsmouth [UK]) and Dr. Anisava
                  Miltenova, with the name <orgName>Computer Supported Processing of Medieval Slavic
                     Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</orgName> (a joint project supported by
                  Central European University). At this time more than one hundred manuscript
                  descriptions were encoded electronically and the project gained in popularity
                  among scholars.</p>
               <p>At the Twelfth International Congress of Slavists in 1998 in Kraków the need for
                  markup technologies and standards and the lack of unified and well-established
                  terminology in the field of Slavic Medieval Studies became obvious, and a new
                     <orgName>Commission for the Computer Processing of Medieval Slavonic
                     Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</orgName> was chartered by the Executive
                  Board of the International Committee of Slavists (Miltenova et al. 1998). Members
                  of the Commission are scholars from more than twelve countries and the main
                  function of the Commission is to serve as a coordinator among projects in the
                  field.</p>
               <p>In 1999–2000 the TEI P3 SGML model was transferred to TEI P4 XML syntax by David
                  J. Birnbaum. The team decided then to change not only the markup language, but
                  also the declarations of some elements and attributes, both to improve the overall
                  structure and to enhance the functionality of the schema. This stage of
                  development was completed in 2001–02. Since then the minor changes and
                  improvements that have been made to the model are, in most cases, backwards
                  compatible. An experimental Repertorium Workstation database was build on the
                  eXist-db native XML database (<ptr target="https://exist-db.org"/>) by David J.
                  Birnbaum (Birnbaum 2009). It uses SVG technology to support the graphic
                  representation of textological differences and similarities.</p>
               <p>This model was presented at conferences in Bulgaria, France, Greece, the
                  Netherlands, Poland, and the USA. Additionally, participants in the Repertorium
                  project conducted courses, lectures, and workshops about the Repertorium in
                  Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, and the USA, .</p>

               <head>Sources for the XML model</head>
               <p>The Repertorium model relies fully on structured markup technologies. The first
                  variant was implemented in 1994–95 as an SGML Document Type Definition (ISO
                  8859:1987), based on TEI P3. The model presented here is based on Extensible
                  Markup Language (XML), a simplified and web-oriented variant of SGML, and
                  specifically on the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI) P5 schemas. The
                  Repertorium model reflects fifteen years of electronic philological descriptions
                  of more than three hundred Slavic medieval and early modern manuscripts.</p>
               <p>From the beginning, the Repertorium manuscript description model, initially called
                  the Template for Slavic Manuscripts (TSM), was based closely on the ideas of the
                  Text Encoding Initiative and the schema fragments used there (TEI). The current
                  Repertorium Initiative XML model for manuscript description is designed as a
                  customization of top of TEI P5, implemented with by means of a TEI ODD
                  customization file. For the publication of Repertorium manuscript descriptions in
                  electronic form, the project relies on XQuery and XSLT scripts that transform the
                  input XML to XML, XHTML, and SVG.</p>

               <head>The Text Encoding Initiative Consortium and the Repertorium</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative uses the TEI models as a principal framework for
                  encoding and interchange. However, the Repertorium model extends some of the TEI
                  element and attribute definitions, thus providing opportunities for the encoder to
                  describe fully specific features of medieval Slavonic texts. Simultaneously with
                  our work, the TEI Consortium published its own model for manuscript description,
                  which is based primarily on the MASTER project, a European Initiative for the
                  description of Western European manuscripts. The principal differences between the
                  Repertorium and TEI models are described in full in appendices to these
                  Guidelines, along with formal definitions of Repertorium-specific additions and
                  other changes to the TEI P5 models.</p>

            <head>Standards and recommendations implied in TEI P5</head>
            <p>Like other projects built on top of TEI P5 by means of ODD, the Repertorium 3.0 model
               can be represented in schemas in XML 1.0 DTD (Bray et al. 2008), Relax NG (Clark,
               Murata 2001, Clark 2002), and W3C Schema (Shudi, Sperberg, Thomson 2009, Peterson et
               al. 2009). From TEI P5 the Repertorium inherits the possibility of using all modern
               standards technologies from the XML family, including, for example, XSLT, XML
               namespaces (Bray et al. 2006), XQuery (Boag et al. 2011), XML Base (Marsh, Tobin
               2009), and others.</p>
            <p>Repertorium 3.0 inherits all constructions in the syntax of attribute values from the
               TEI P5 infrastructure, where they are, in turn, expressed according to
               recommendations of the W3 Consortium and ISO standards, and various RFCs and BCPs.
               The attribute values for language codes follow BCP 47 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which
               comprises RFC 4646 (Philips, Davis 2006a) and RFC 4647 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which,
               in turn, follow ISO standards (cf. ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2). Four-letter codes for the
               names of scripts are from ISO 15924 (ISO 15924). Data in attributes that provide
               pointers to other locations in the same or in other documents (e.g.,
                  <att>target</att> or <att>lemmaRef</att>) should be expressed in terms of RFC 3986
               (Berners-Lee et al 2005). Temporal expressions in attributes follow the W3C XML
               Schema recommendation or ISO 8601 (cf. Shudi, Sperberg, Thomson 2009, Peterson et al
               2009, ISO 8601).</p>
            <div>
               <head>Visualization and publication</head>
               <p>Previous versions of the Repertorium use the XLink recommendation (DeRose et al.
                  2000) and CSS techniques (Bos et al. 2008) to visualize XML data directly without
                  transformation. In the current version this approach has been abandoned in favour
                  of transformation to XHTML (Altheim, McCarron 2001) and possibly to PDF through
                  XSLT and XSL-FO scripts. TEI P5 versions are managed with an XSL framework (made
                  available by Sebastian Rahtz) which can be further customized to meet the needs of
                  a particular project.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Public identifier and XML namespaces</head>
               <p>Until now the Repertorium Initiative has had no Public Identifier (PI), and
                  instead used system identifiers (SI) and XML catalog files (cf. Bray et al. 2008,
                  Walsh 2001). Beginning with the current version of the Repertorium guidelines, the
                  following PI will be used: <code>-// Repertorium//DTD Repertorium XML
                     V3.0/EN</code>.</p>
               <p>For use with modern schema languages an XML Namespace designation is needed, and
                  we use <code>http://www.ilit.bas.bg/repertorium/ns/3.0</code>. All elements
                  defined by the TEI in the TEI namespace preserve their value despite the fact that
                  their content could be changed in some way, and only elements that are not present
                  in the TEI models are implemented in the Repertorium namespace.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The modules</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative was intended from the ground up to be constructed as a
                  model for the description of medieval Slavic manuscripts. However in its XML
                  implementation it also has the ability to serve as a framework for the description
                  of other medieval traditions, such as Greek or Latin, because the philological
                  approaches for such investigations are much more similar than different. The
                  structures of catalogues of medieval European manuscripts share most of the same
                  features and should give answers to the same questions related to manuscript
                  contents, palaeography, and codicology.</p>
               <p>Using the TEI infrastructure makes it possible to implement several parts of an
                  electronic text project within the same model. For example, it becomes possible to
                  express all imaginable aspects of text edition, source description, and graphical
                  representation of a text object, providing ready-to-use models at least in the
                  following areas:</p>
               <list rend="simple">
                  <item>description of the source (in our case, a manuscript) edition of the text
                     (with the appropriate segmentation into separate text units, apparatus
                     criticus, annotation of linguistic features, pointers to graphical
                     representations of the original source, etc.)</item>
                  <item>encoding bibliographic records related to description and edition</item>
                  <item>encoding metadata, including terms of use</item>
                  <item>construction of a model of a print dictionary</item>
                  <item>technical documentation of the XML infrastructure (model classes, elements,
                     entities, attributes, etc.)</item>
               </list>
               <p>The TEI model that has served as the foundation for the Repertorium schema is
                  designed specifically to support the description of medieval manuscripts. The
                  required modules are:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item><ident>tei</ident> – the main module of the TEI Infrastructure (Burnard,

               <p>In addition to these required modules, several optional ones have been

               <head>Some principles</head>
               <p>It was necessary to make a very precise comparison between the TEI P5 module for
                  manuscript description and the Repertorium model in order to reach the maximum
                  level of compatibility and interchangeability. To fulfill this task several
                  principles were formulated to govern that transformation of the prior Repertorium
                  schema into the present one:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>All attributes and elements from the core and additional tag sets that have
                     been changed from TEI P4 to TEI P5 are changed in Repertorium 3.0, as
                     well.</item>
                  <item>All attributes and elements that share the same functionality between TEI P5
                     and Repertorium are renamed in favour of TEI P5.</item>
                  <item>No customizations are made on the level of TEI macro structures or on the
                     level of model classes with the exception of: model classes related to specific
                     manuscript description elements; exclusion of all numbered divLike models and
                     their corresponding elements. This includes removal of <gi>div1</gi>,
                        <gi>div2</gi>, <gi>div3</gi>, <gi>div4</gi>, <gi>div5</gi>, <gi>div6</gi>,
                     and <gi>div7</gi></item>
                  <item>When there is an element with the same name in TEI P5 and the Repertorium,
                     it is declared in the TEI, not the Repertorium, namespace, even if the given
                     element name has its roots in Repertorium Initiative.</item>
                  <item>When there is no functional possibility in the Repertorium model to express
                     particular features, the elements from TEI P5 with their names are taken
                     without further customization. This is the case, for example, with element
                        <gi>additional</gi>.</item>
                  <item>When the same information with the same functional characteristics is
                     expressed in different places in TEI P5 and the Repertorium, the choice is made
                     in favour of the former. This is the case with the definition of manuscript
                     origin. In early versions of the Repertorium schema this was expressed with a
                     special element <gi>manuscriptCreation</gi>, placed before the content
                     description. However, in TEI P5 there is an element <gi>origin</gi> with a
                     similar function, which is part of the manuscript history, placed almost at the
                     end of the schema. In this case the latter element has been chosen.</item>
                  <item>When elements with different names share the same functional characteristics
                     even if their declarations differ to some extent, the elements from the TEI
                     namespace are chosen. This is the case, for example, with the element
                        <gi>msItemStruct</gi> which replaces the original Repertorium
                        <gi>articleContentDesc</gi>, and the element <gi>filiation</gi> with the
                     special attribute <att>type</att> which replaces <gi>antigraph</gi>,
                        <gi>apograph</gi>, <gi>litRedaction</gi>, <gi>protograph</gi>,
                        <gi>source</gi> and <gi>translation</gi>.</item>
                  <item>If one of the models provides a more general and simpler view and the other
                     has a structured model of the same information, an attempt is made to integrate
                     both approaches in the declaration of element. This is the case, for example,
                     with the <gi>bindingDesc</gi>. The declaration of this element in TEI P5 is:
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> &lt;!ELEMENT bindingDesc
                        ((%model.pLike; | decoNote | condition)+ |binding+)&gt; </egXML>
                     <p>Then the content of <gi>binding</gi> is declared as <egXML
                           xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> &lt;!ELEMENT binding
                           (%model.pLike; | condition | decoNote)+&gt; </egXML></p>
                     <p>The proposed model leaves the declaration of <gi>bindingDesc</gi> without
                        changes but modifies the content of the element <gi>binding</gi> to include
                        structured information:</p>
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> &lt;!ELEMENT binding
                        (%model.pLike; | bindingNote |condition | decoNote)+&gt; </egXML></item>
                  <item> If there is an element in the Repertorium that has the same name as in TEI
                     P5 but a different meaning, the Repertorium element is removed or renamed. An
                     example of such an element is <gi>writing</gi>, which was used in earlier
                     Repertorium schemas to provide general palaeographic information. An element
                     with the same name exists in P5 with a completely different meaning („a passage
                     of written text revealed to participants in the course of a spoken text”, cf.
                     Burnard, Bauman 2007), so the Repertorium element was changed to
                        <gi>summary</gi> in the schema.</item>
                  <item> Specific Repertorium elements and structures from earlier versions are
                     retained only if there are structural or semantic differences between the
                     Repertorium and TEI models. One example is the element <gi>scribeDesc</gi>,

            <head>The main Structure</head>
            <p>A manuscript description can occur in two different places in a Repertorium XML
               document. When the description (cataloguing information) serves as an introduction to
               the digital representation of transcribed text, it is encoded inside the
                  <gi>teiHeader</gi> element that provides metadata for the edition itself. However,
               when the goal of the project is focused on manuscript descriptions, without
               transcribed full text, the descriptive elements and content are regarded as primary
               data and the description itself becomes a primary object. In this case it serves no
               longer as metadata and must be entered as part of the content of the element
                  <gi>body</gi>.</p>
            <p>The basic, wrapper element for a description is called <gi>msDesc</gi> (manuscript
               description) and it serves as a container for seven additional parts: general
               cataloguing information (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>); headings (<gi>head</gi>);
               information on physical characteristics and layout of the manuscript
                  (<gi>physDesc</gi>); palaeographical and linguistic data (<gi>scribeDesc</gi>);
               the description of the manuscript content as a whole, as separate texts, and its
               notes and colophon(s) (<gi>msContents</gi>); conclusions about the time and place of
               writing of the manuscript and a sketch of the manuscript’s history
               (<gi>history</gi>); as well as a place for additional information the describer may
               need to encode (element <gi>additional</gi>).</p>
            <p>Convolutes and palimpsest parts are described as part of the element <gi>msPart</gi>.
               Additional notes by the authors of earlier descriptions and by owners of the
               manuscript form part of the element <gi>accMat</gi>.</p>
            <p>The specification of the source could be extended further as part of the
                  <gi>recordHist</gi> (recorded history) element at the end of the description (cf.
               Additional information).</p>
            <p>Only one part of this information is mandatory and must always appear in the
               description: <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. All other main elements are optional.</p>
            <p>Information is entered step by step, in an ordered and purposeful way. The first step
               concerns general cataloguing information, then comes information related to physical
               features of the manuscript, palaeography, language, content, sources of manuscript
               description and, finally, administrative information, such as custodial history,
               restoration, available photocopies and bibliographic information.</p>

               <head>Levels of representation</head>
               <p>Descriptions of medieval manuscripts may differ significantly both in structure
                  and length. There exist many traditions in cataloguing medieval materials, which
                  means that similar information can look different in different frameworks. The
                  first thing to consider is the completeness and length of the description.</p>

                     will allow data extraction without loss of information. For example, small
                     summaries or overviews might coexist with more elaborated, structured features
                     of manuscript or text analysis, e.g.:</p>

                  <item>identification of manuscript name, as a type or genre (e.g., Menaion or
                     Triodion) or as a specific name that has become standardized in the research
                     tradition (e.g., Euchologium Sinaiticum);</item>
                  <item> information about where the manuscript is kept, together with its

                  <item>optional additional notes</item>
               </list>
               <p>The description thus begins with answers to questions like: What is the name of
                  the manuscript? Where it is now kept? and Are there earlier descriptions? The
                  answers to all of these questions constitute part of the content of the element
                     <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (i.e., manuscript identifier, Burnard &amp; Bauman
                  2007).</p>
               <p>The encoder can provide information about the name of the manuscript
                     (<gi>msName</gi>) if it exists, and about the country, geographical region
                  and/or city, and the institution, repository, or collection (Burnard &amp; Bauman
                  2007: <code lang="XML">model.placeNamePart</code>).</p>
               <p>Between <gi>msName</gi> and following structured information it is possible to
                  insert a brief summary description in the form of paragraph (cf. below). More
                  information, including optional bibliographic records or lists of records, may be

               <p>The element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (manuscript identifier) has <att>type</att> and
                     <att>subtype</att> attributes. These attributes may be used, for example, when
                  the manuscript is now lost or its place is now unknown, so that the type of
                  identifier is not current, and the electronic form represents an encoding of an
                  old description, and not the de visu work of the current encoder.</p>

            <div>
               <head>The manuscript name</head>
               <p>The name of the manuscript is a word or a short phrase that can be used to
                  classify the manuscript according to a known scheme and to provide a special or
                  supplied name that has become established by the research tradition.</p>
               <p>There are many characteristics involved in assigning a name to a manuscript. The
                  most important is the so-called generic or unified name, based on typological
                  characteristics, with values such as <emph>Psalter</emph> or
                     <emph>Miscellany</emph>. In some cases manuscripts may also already have unique
                  names, such as <emph>Codex Zographensis</emph> or <emph>Kodov Triodion</emph>.
                  These names should be provided separately.</p>
               <p>This element may contain only plain text. The <att>type</att> attribute may be
                  used to give further information whether the name is general (i.e., unified or
                  generic) or individual (nickname).</p>
               <p>The following example from the description of Codex Marianus demonstrates the use
                  of this element:</p>

               <p>When the manuscript has different nicknames for separate parts that are kept in
                  different repositories, this information goes into corresponding sections of
                  description. As in case with <emph>Codex Marianus</emph>, there are two leaves now
                  kept in Vienna that have been known by two names that are no longer generally
                  used: <emph>Mihanović folia</emph> and <emph>Miklošič folia</emph>:</p>

               <p>The use of this paragraph is restricted to cases when special annotation is needed
                  to summarize the locations of different parts of the same manuscript. The current
                  location in different countries, archives, or collections could require a special
                  introduction to this state with possible links to sections on manuscript history,
                  acquisition, and to the various signatures or numbers in the catalogues. The
                  following extract from the description of <emph>Manuilev Apostolos</emph>
                  illustrates this approach:</p>

               <p>This short introduction to the cataloguing information in the description of the
                     <emph>Manuilev Apostle</emph> is needed to understand the rest of the
                  description. The formal declaration of the element <gi>p</gi> (paragraph) is used
                  exactly as the same element in TEI models (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: p).</p>

                  <p>The next part of the electronic cataloguing information is devoted to the place
                     where the manuscript is kept. There are three levels for this information:
                     geographical pointers, institutional identification, and (optionally) data
                     regarding the collection in which the manuscript is kept. The latter often
                     appears as part of the shelfmark designation.</p>
                  <p>The specified order of elements is important, going from largest to
                     smallest:</p>
                  <list type="numbered">
                     <item>country</item>
                     <item>geographical region</item>
                     <item>city or place name</item>
                     <item>repository</item>
                     <item>collection</item>
                     <item>shelfmark, inventory number or some other designation</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This set of elements is followed by optional information on identification
                     based on <term>secundo folio </term>and bibliographic records.</p>
                  <p>Following example from the description of Ms NBKM 848 illustrates the usage of
                     the element:</p>

               <div>
                  <head>Country</head>
                  <p>The most simple content of the element <gi>country</gi> is the name of country,
                     e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                     ><country>Bulgaria</country></egXML>
                  <p>In some cases it may be useful to provide a country code as well as a country
                     name. This can be achieved by supplying a value to the key attribute. It is
                     recommended by the TEI that this value follow the country names and codes
                     defined by ISO 3166 (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: country). The encoder can
                     choose among three representations defined in the standard: alpha-2 code
                     (two-letter, ISO 3166-1-alpha-2-code), alpha-3 code (three-letter, ISO
                     3166-1-alpha-3-code), and numeric code (ISO 3166-numeric). The three variants
                     are illustrated below:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     <country key="100">Bulgaria</country> For the full list cf. Common Data Hub:

               <div>
                  <head>Settlement (city or town, etc.)</head>
                  <p>The next part of the information is related to the place where the manuscript
                     is currently kept. Two different elements are provided for this purpose. In
                     most cases the manuscript is kept in libraries or archives in cities, for which
                     the element settlement is used:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <settlement>Sankt Peterburg</settlement>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>The type of settlement may be further specified by adding a standard type, as
                     in this example:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <settlement type="town">Kazanlăk</settlement>
                  </egXML>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Region</head>
                  <p>When the name of place is not well-known or there could be two or more places
                     with the same name, an additional element <gi>region</gi> may be added. By
                        <gi>region</gi> is meant an administrative unit smaller than a country but
                     larger than a city, town or village (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: region).</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <region type="district">Sofia</region>
                     <settlement type="village">Alino</settlement>
                  </egXML>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>The place and geographical names</head>
                  <p>When the codex is kept in a specific place not normally considered a region or
                     settlement, e.g., in a monastery, the alternative elements <gi>placeName</gi>
                     and <gi>geogName</gi> may be used. These elements are part of the TEI element
                     infrastructure and may contain plain text, sub-elements like <gi>region</gi>
                     (for some places that are smaller than countries, but bigger than cities) or
                        <gi>district</gi> (for names of non-administrative, geographical places).
                     With the help of <gi>geogFeat</gi> we can encode such geographical features as
                     valley, river, mount, etc. (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: geogFeat). Then we can
                     provide the name of the place using general purpose <gi>name</gi> element.</p>
                  <p>The choice in this case should be made on the level of the whole project,
                     unifying the appearance of the information in order to format, transform or
                     search the data. For example, a possible encoding for manuscripts kept at the
                     Zograph Monastery on Mount Athos could look like the following:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <geogName>
                        <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                        <name>Athos</name>
                     </geogName>
                     <placeName type="monastery">Zograph monastery</placeName>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>The same information could be encoded in two other ways. The first is using a
                     general purpose element <gi>name</gi> with <att>type</att>, e. g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <name type="monastery">Zograph monastery</name>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>The other is to use a special referencing string as the value of the
                        <att>key</att> attribute, e. g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <placeName key="ZM" type="monastery">Zograph Monastery</placeName>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>In the last example the <gi>placeName</gi> element has two special attributes.
                     As explained in the TEI Guidelines <att>key</att> „provides an
                     externally-defined means of identifying the entity (or entities) being named,
                     using a coded value of some kind.” (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:
                        <code>att.canonical/key</code>) and <att>type</att> is intended to be used
                     as a general characteristic of the place name. That means that project should
                     have a list of abbreviations of some sort, one of which must be ZM (= Zograph
                     Monastery). For the manuscripts kept at Mount Sinai „St. Catherine” the same
                     model is also valid, e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Egypt</country>
                     <geogName>
                        <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                        <name>Sinai</name>
                     </geogName>
                  </egXML>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Repository (library, archive, etc.)</head>
                  <p>The next piece of information in the electronic description,
                        <gi>repository</gi>, identifies a public or private library or archive. This
                     element should contain a common or official designation, as in this
                     example:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Czech Republic</country>

                  <head>Name of the institution</head>
                  <p>Sometimes the repository is part of another institution, and in such cases the
                     name of the institution comes before the name of the archive, as in the
                     following examples:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  </egXML>
                  <p>or</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  </egXML>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Shelfmarks, inventory and catalogue designations</head>
                  <p>This information forms the content of the element <gi>idno</gi>. This element
                     has an <att>type</att> value that specifies whether the identification is a
                     shelfmark, inventory number, or catalogue number. This attribute value is
                     especially important in archives that combine several collections that may be
                     arranged and identified according to former owners or thematic principles. In
                     practice, shelfmarks are often formed from the initials or special codes for
                     separate collections. Typical examples could be:</p>
                  <p>1. shelfmark:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <p>2. Designation in the catalogue:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <idno type="catalogue">1</idno>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>3. Information on identification in inventory catalogue:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <idno type="inventory">5/1946</idno>

               <div>
                  <head>Current and former shelfmarks, catalogue and inventory numbers</head>
                  <p>The best way to differentiate between current and former designations is to
                     wrap the element <gi>idno</gi> around <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements. Consider

                     it is described in the catalogue as item number 20.</p>
                  <p>By setting the value of <att>type</att> in the <gi>altIdentifier</gi> element
                     the encoder can choose between the values current and former and then further
                     define values in its sub-elements, e.g.:</p>

                  <p>Some repositories use a complex archiving system with special divisions between
                     the separate collections and archives. Very often the names of the sections
                     bear the names of previous owners or commissioners, which can be represented
                     with the <gi>collection</gi> element. The <att>type</att> and
                        <att>subtype</att> attributes are available for cases where a more detailed
                     characterization is necessary.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>collection</gi> element may contain unstructured (plain) text,
                     e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     P. Syrku under the number 15.</p>
                  <p>When thе <gi>collection</gi> element appears, it is immediately followed by the
                     shelfmark or inventory number as an identification inside the collection:</p>

                  <p>In some cases the current collection of some repository contains an entire
                     earlier repository collection. This is often the case in Russian collections
                     like the National Russian Library in Sankt-Petersburg, the Historical Museum,
                     the State Russian Library and the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts. In
                     this case it is helpful to include this information, as well, e.g.:</p>

                  <head>Once again about the usage of <gi>altIdentifier</gi> and <gi>idno
                     </gi>elements</head>
                  <p>In an analytical catalogue where there may be combinations of former and
                     current collections and shelfmarks in a repository it is often useful to encode
                     all these designations. The encoder can then further explain the history of the
                     manuscript in sections about its origin, provenance and acquisition.</p>
                  <p>The usage of <gi>altIdentifier</gi> in the Repertorium approach as a
                     sub-element of <gi>msIdentifier</gi> is to define the current or old
                     identification of a codex or to distinguish among parts of one and the same
                     manuscript dispersed in one or in various repositories.</p>
                  <p>The element <gi>idno</gi>, on the other hand, is used for various kinds of
                     designations, such as shelfmarks and inventory or catalogue numbers. In this
                     approach, if we have a part of the manuscript in one repository with an old
                     shelfmark or collection identification that is still in use, it is necessary to
                     allow <gi>altIdentifier</gi> to appear elsewhere, in the description of other
                     parts, as in:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <altIdentifier type="partial" xml:id="RSL_Grig14">
                        <country>Russia</country>
                        <settlement>Moscow</settlement>
                        <repository>Russian State Library</repository>
                        <idno type="shelfmark">Grig. 14</idno>
                        <collection>V. Grigorovic</collection>
                        <altIdentifier type="former">
                           <idno type="shelfmark">M. 1696</idno>
                        </altIdentifier>
                     </altIdentifier>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>In this example both Grig. 14 and M. 1696 are used as identifications in the
                     tradition in spite of the fact that the latter points to the previous owner. In
                     this case the shelfmark signifies the intermediate change of owner. Further
                     details should be given in the section about the history of the codex.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Secundo folio</head>
                  <p>This element is very rare in the Slavic medieval and early modern tradition,
                     but for western medieval manuscripts it has been (mainly between the thirteenth
                     and sixteenth centuries) a common component of manuscript description. The term
                     refers to transcribing the first word or words from the second leaf of a codex.
                     The element <gi>secFol</gi> (Lat. secundo folio, or Eng. second folio) is used
                     for this purpose (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007: <gi>secFol</gi>). The following
                     example illustrates the usage:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                        <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements as part of the content of a <gi>note</gi>
                     element. Typical information includes internal or external bibliographic or
                     other pointers, notes about the attribution of a manuscript, etc.</p>

               <head>General remarks</head>
               <p>The markup definition of the physical structure should be entered in the element
                     <gi>physDesc</gi> (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007), which unites information about
                  the physical condition of the manuscript with observations about the material,
                  layout, binding and decoration. The encoder can choose between two options:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>To make a very short sketch of different features of the manuscript in
                     paragraphs, or</item>
                  <item>2. To use special elements for the description of material, layout, binding,
                     decoration, etc.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the former approach the encoder should use only paragraphs, as in this
                  example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     <p>The codex is in good condition. The folios containing the Table of contents
                        are now unfolded. Originally they formed the last quire of the
                        manuscript</p>
                  </physDesc> (From the electronic description of MS CIAI 369 by Margaret Dimitrova,
                  simplified) </egXML>
               <p>The element <gi>physDesc</gi> has no special attributes. Its only use is to
                  contain other elements, which encode the physical characteristics of the
                  manuscript.</p>
               <p>The second approach also permits the use of the element <gi>p</gi>, in this case
                  for an introduction to the physical description.</p>

                  2007) of this attribute could be codex, roll, fragment, leaf, partial leaf or some
                  typologically relevant value, e.g.</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <objectDesc form="codex"> ... </objectDesc> or <objectDesc form="roll"> ...
                  </objectDesc>
               </egXML>
               <p>This information could be entered as an unstructured sequence of paragraphs, or as
                  part of the content of the specialized elements <gi>supportDesc</gi> and
                     <gi>layoutDesc</gi> .</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Description of physical support</head>
               <p>The information in <gi>supportDesc</gi> could be also entered in two ways: 1) as
                  an unstructured (paragraph) view, or 2) using specialized elements. Here we
                  illustrate an overview of the use of structured data for various aspects of
                  cataloguing the support.</p>
               <p><gi>supportDesc</gi> has one important attribute, <att>material</att>. The value
                  of this attribute, as suggested by TEI Guidelines (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:
                     <gi>supportDesc</gi>), is most commonly parchment, paper, or mixed, as in this
                  example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <supportDesc material="paper"> ... </supportDesc>
               </egXML>
               <p>The meaning of the value of this attribute is to give a general type of the
                  material of the manuscript, and it is not associated with the possible
                  construction of manuscript’s binding or the box in which the manuscript is kept.
                  Especially in cases when the value is „mixed,” a further explanation should be
                  provided.</p>
               <p>The order of information in this element is significant, and follows traditional
                  paper-based descriptions. There is no required minimal content, and the range of
                  information depends on the opportunities the researcher may have had to work with
                  the manuscript de visu. The brief explanation of the proposed elements is as
                  follows:</p>
               <p><gi>support</gi> – describes in more detail the material of the leaves or roll</p>
               <p><gi>extent</gi> – describes the size of manuscript in terms like number of folia
                  or pages, or the length of the roll;</p>
               <p><gi>foliation</gi> and/or <gi>pagination</gi> – information about whether the
                  manuscript is foliated (paginated), with further explanation;</p>
               <p><gi>collation</gi> – description of the folia collation, ruling, pricking and
                  other techniques related to the quire structure;</p>
               <p><gi>condition</gi> – an overview of possible damage, absence or additions of
                  folia, blank leaves, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Detailed description of material</head>
               <p>This information could be entered as plain text in the form of paragraphs
                     (<gi>p</gi>) in the element <gi>support</gi> or as one or more instances of the
                  element <gi>material</gi>. It contains a brief statement that can serve as an
                  overview of a more in-depth description that can follow. Here is an example of the
                  first type:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <support>
                     <p>Paper with <watermark>Harbalet in Ring</watermark>: similar to
                           <bibl>Harlfinger Nr. 2/a</bibl> from the years 1471-1472</p>
                  </support> (From the electronic description of MS Rila 3/6 by Dilyana Radoslavova,
                  simplified) </egXML>
               <p>However, in the case of an analytical description we may choose to use a paragraph
                  as just an introduction to a more elaborate description of the material, or we may
                  use only one or more <gi>material</gi> elements, often depending on the
                  completeness of information we have. For example, if we are describing a
                  manuscript that we have not been able to examine de visu, or are making an
                  electronic edition of an old catalogue, we may lack information about the paper or
                  quality of parchment. In such cases we may ignore the <gi>support</gi> section of
                  description and provide the information we do have only as the value of the
                  attribute <att>material</att> in the element <gi>supportDesc</gi>, as in the
                  example above.</p>
               <p>In contrast with this, when we use one or more <gi>material</gi> elements not as
                  part of <gi>p</gi>, that means that we have enough information to complete a
                  parchment or paper description of the codex. Consider the following example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <supportDesc material="mixed">

                        <material key="paper">Here is the information on paper. </material>

               </egXML>
               <p>Here the <att>key</att> attribute is used to distinguish the different materials
                  in the manuscript. The element <gi>material</gi> can include an attribute
                     <att>material</att>, with values that might include (but are not limited
                  to):</p>

               <head>Description of parchment</head>
               <p>The parchment description is restricted to the technological process and its outer
                  appearance. However, the encoder might wish to add a statement regarding the
                  origin, quality, colour and thickness of the parchment, as in these examples:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <material key="parchment" usage="original">More probably sheep than calf...of

               <div>
                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>The description of paper in recent catalogues is much more complicated than the
                     description of parchment. On the one hand, there are various levels of detailed
                     information in the catalogues, and, on the other, there are much more
                     specialized research initiatives in the field of paper and watermark studies.
                     Therefore, the description of the paper in a manuscript could consist of an
                     overview and comments followed by a description of watermark(s) and of other
                     aspects of the paper production:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <material usage="original">

                     the electronic description of Add. Ms 37233 by Dilyana Radoslavova, simplified) </egXML>
                  <p>The description of obviously different kind of paper, possibly from various
                     manufactures, and of varying quality and age could be accomplished by repeating
                     the element <gi>material</gi> and its attributes exactly in the same manner as
                     it is implemented for the description of parchment.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Watermarks</head>
                  <p>The central and most important information in the description of the paper is
                     the watermark. The information on its characteristics is part of the element
                        <gi>watermark</gi>. The content of this element includes phrase level
                     elements, as well as specialized elements like <gi>countermark</gi> and
                        <gi>motif</gi>.</p>
                  <p>There are several special attributes for the content of this element
                        <gi>tracing</gi> is used to describe very briefly (with one word) the method
                     of watermark tracing. The most usual method is still drawing by hand, but there
                     could be other possibilities like rubbing by hand, usage of special Dylux print
                     paper, beta- or x-radiography, scanning, etc. Further more the <att>place</att>
                     from the <code>class att.placement</code> can refine where on the pages the
                     watermark could be seen. This feature could be described in relation to wire
                     lines and chain (laid) lines. The possible content might read something like:
                     chain lines regularly spaced, between chain lines more widely spaced, on a
                     chain line, on a supplemental chain line, across 2 chain lines, across 3 chain
                     lines, or could be expressed in some other terms, e.g., in millimeters between
                     various points of the leaf.</p>
                  <div>
                     <head>Motif</head>
                     <p>The element <gi>motif</gi> is the most important part of the watermark
                        description because it is intended to give a special terminological
                        apparatus of watermark design.</p>
                     <p>There are several ways to add information on this subject:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>In the absence of reference books and watermark albums, simply as
                           plain text;</item>
                        <item>If a more complicated motif is present and the encoder would like to
                           provide full compatibility with professional watermark databases, with
                           the attribute <att>type</att>, as described below;</item>
                        <item>By secondary is meant designs above or below the basic motif.
                           Frequently used motifs above the basic one include bird, cross, flower,
                           monograms, monograms with a combination with figures (e.g., monogram BA
                           and cross), ramrod, different star shapes, star and monogram, trefoil,
                           etc. Frequently used motifs below the basic one include grapes,
                           monograms, etc.;</item>
                        <item>By supplemental is meant supplemental characteristics of the basic
                           motif, e.g., in circle, in oval, in shield, etc.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>In this approach the usual description of the motif “anchor in circle with
                        5-point star above” could be encoded as:</p>

               <p>The meaning of this note is to enable the encoder to describe other features of
                  the material, which is especially important for the description of paper. Although
                  not structured in a systematic way, the information to be entered here might
                  involve:</p>
               <p><term>Wire lines</term>: The relevant information of wire lines could contain:</p>
               <list rend="simple">
                  <item>The density of the wire lines as the measure of 20 wirelines (in mm) — a
                     standard procedure common in paper descriptions;</item>
                  <item>Description of wire lines, usually in terms like: thin wire lines; thick
                     wire lines; alternating thick and thin; very thick wire lines; thick wire
                     lines, thin lines at edges; wire lines in corrugated pattern; wires wrapped
                     around the chain lines; alternate wires wrapped around the chains; etc.</item>
               </list>
               <p><term>Chain or laid lines</term>: The most important feature of the chain lines is
                  the spacing between them, which could be described by entering the element
                     <gi>dim</gi> and its sub element <gi>height</gi>. The following are
                  recommendations from the Watermark Initiative: “If the watermark is on the chain
                  line the spaces on either side of it should be given in parentheses:
                  28,25,(15,14),28,25. If the watermark is positioned between or across two chain
                  lines, the space between them should be given in parentheses: 44,45,(50),47,43“
                  (http://abacus.bates.edu/Faculty/wmarchive/FORM_ descriptions.html). An example of
                  such description is provided as well: “04. Wire/Chain line description: Density of
                  Wirelines: 26 mm. for 20 wirelines. (style: thin wirelines) Chain line
                  Interval(s): / 50 mm.”</p>
               <p><term>Paper or parchment thickness</term>: The data on paper thickness could be
                  entered in the element <gi>dim</gi> with the <att>type</att> attribute and a
                  thickness value. This value could be relative, e.g.: very thin, thin, medium thin,
                  medium, medium thick, thick, very thick; or, alternatively, it could be measured
                  in another way.</p>
               <p><term>Paper or parchment colour</term>: This information could be entered as
                  content of the element <gi>colour</gi>.</p>
               <p><term>Texture</term>: For paper terms in common use include: smooth, matte, fuzzy,
                  patina, glazed, bumpy, etc. One might also record whether the dark fibres and wire
                  lines are visible on the surface of the paper.</p>
               <p><term>Stiffness</term>: Information about the stiffness of paper is rare in
                  manuscript descriptions, but possible values could include: stiff, crisp, supple,
                  limp, etc.</p>
               <p><term>Date of the paper</term>: Usually the dating of the paper is part of the
                  watermark description. This is the most familiar place because the watermark image
                  is the most characteristic part of the paper description. In addition to providing
                  the date or date range, the encoder could further specify the justification for
                  the dating. Possible values could include:</p>

               <p>The number of folia in the manuscript is entered in the element <gi>extent</gi>,

                  following example from the description of the manuscript 369 from the Church
                  Historical and Archival Institute in Sofia:</p>

               <p>It is possible to include links to the information in the same file or outside it,

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>All sorts of dimensions could be entered into the element <gi>dimensions</gi>,
                     and the attribute <att>type</att> gives a hint to the encoder of possible uses
                     for the element. The attribute <att>unit</att> provides three possible
                     characteristics and <att>scope</att> emphasizes the range of these
                     dimensions.</p>
                  <p>The element <gi>dimensions</gi> could be can be used in many places where
                     measurement is requirement, and it has three special attributes for that
                     purpose. The attribute <att>type</att> provides a common typology of the
                     dimensions of a given manuscript source. Possible values comprise all important
                     parts of the manuscript physical description and layout. Commonly used
                     dimensions are those of leaves, page written area and the height of the
                     characters or lines. The author of the description may, however, find it useful
                     to mention also the dimensions of the ruled or pricked region of the page and
                     quire, as well as to provide measurements for the borders as part of the
                     binding. It is even possible to distinguish the dimension of a single letter in
                     comparison to the whole line.</p>
                  <p>The most useful units of measurement in manuscript description are
                        <term>mm</term> and <term>cm</term>, but sometimes, especially in the
                     description of initials, a measurement in lines per page or characters per line
                     (chars) could be more useful than exact measures.</p>
                  <p>To supply information on the possible range of dimensions the compiler of the
                     catalogue information may find it convenient to use the attribute
                        <att>scope</att> with the exact value of a particular part of the
                     manuscript.</p>

               <p>Both elements have the same content and structure, and include information about
                  when the foliation or pagination was made, whether it is original, and how the
                  folia or pages are marked or numbered, e.g.:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <head>Collation</head>
               <p>The description of collation offers three alternatives: 1) to describe the general
                  collation using the element <gi>p</gi> for an unstructured description; 2) to
                  begin with a general overview using the element <gi>p</gi> but also to describe
                  such characteristics as signatures, catchwords, pricking, ruling or dispositions
                  of folia in the gatherings in separate elements; or 3) when some of the quires
                  deviate from the general rules, to describe them in one or more separate
                     <gi>quire</gi> elements.</p>
               <p>A simple description could include the element <gi>p</gi> with a formula,
                  e.g.:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <collation><p><formula>I (8 -i), II(8), III(8-i), IV-XIX(8), XX(4.4+2),

                  <head>Signatures</head>
                  <p>An important part of the description of quires is how they are marked at their
                     beginning and/or end. The description should include a phrase defining the form
                     and place at the beginning and end of the quire, as well as any changes,
                     e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <signatures>The original markings of the quires through letters is preserved

               <div>
                  <head>Description of each quire</head>
                  <p>The element <gi>quire</gi> brings together all possible features for the
                     characterization of the quire, including number, composition, how and where
                     there are marked, and with the assistance of what tool.</p>
                  <p>The element <gi>formula</gi> provides information about how the quire is
                     composed, of how many folia, etc. The content of this element is a formula.
                     Consider the following example:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <collation>
                        <quire n="I"><extent>2</extent><formula>8 (-1-2-3-4-5-6) </formula></quire>
                        <quire n="II-XXI"><extent>8</extent></quire>
                        <quire n="XXII"><extent>7</extent><formula>7 (-7)</formula>
                        </quire>
                        <quire n="XXIII"><extent>2</extent><formula>6 (-1-2-3-4) </formula></quire>
                        ... </collation>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>This means that first quire of the manuscript was formed of 8 ff., all of
                     which, with the exception of the f. 7, are now missing. Quires II to XXI have 8
                     ff. each. From quire XXII one folio (7) is missing. The last, quire XXIII,
                     consisted originally of 6 ff. but only 2 of them (5 and 6) are preserved
                     intact.</p>

               <div>
                  <head>Gregory rule or the rule of parchment arrangement in the quire</head>
                  <p>The arrangement of the parchment folia as part of the quire structure is
                     entered here. Only de visu observations can identify the sequence and order of
                     parchment folia. There are two common abbreviations: HS – for the hair (dark)
                     side, and FS – for the flesh (light) side of the parchment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the content of this element could be a sequence of HS and FS
                     abbreviations, e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <gregoryRule>HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS-FS|HS = HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS- FS|HS</gregoryRule>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>Here the sign <code>|</code> separates pages, <code>–</code> separates folia,
                     and <code>=</code> signifies the middle of the quire. In cases where there is
                     no rule, or there are deviations from it, this should be stated explicitly. If
                     the deviations are caused by the loss of leaves, it is possible to insert a
                     link pointing to the place where this loss is explained, e.g., in the content
                     of the element <gi>condition</gi>.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Ruling patterns and types</head>
                  <p>Two kinds of information regarding medieval manuscripts could be entered in the
                     element <gi>ruling</gi>. The first is related to the ruling type defined by
                     researchers such as Leroy (1976) or Gilissen (1977), who attempted to propose
                     well-defined typologies of ruling types. In the other, information is related
                     to the place of ruling in the quire, or the so called „scheme.” The former
                     could be expressed as a formula of ruled lines for writing, and the latter
                     could be visualized as simple graphic showing the places in the quire where the
                     ruling is accomplished, e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> &gt;&gt; | &gt; | |&lt; |&lt;&lt;
                     = &gt;&gt;| &gt;| |&lt; | &lt;&lt; </egXML>
                  <p>This scheme means that in this quire the ruling is made for each of the two
                     folia: once for the outer double leaf and once for the inner one (double sign
                     &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;). The symbols &gt; or &lt; mean that on the leaf there is
                     just a trace of the ruling made on the previous leaf. The attribute
                        <att>type</att> should provide information about the classification scheme
                     (Gillisen or Leroy for example) employed.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Prickings</head>
                  <p>Such observations are relatively rare in the literature. However, as described
                     by Jones (1946a, 1946b), they could bear information on scriptorial techniques.
                     Thus, it is necessary to provide an element for such types of information.</p>

                  binding or the whole manuscript. Traces of restoration processes could be encoded
                  in this element as well. A possible example could be:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <condition>The manuscript is in good condition except for the last gathering, in
                     which there is damage along the lower edge of the leaves, which have been
                     repaired and the text restored in a style very close to the
                     original.</condition> From the electronic description of British Library Add

               <head>Description of the page layout</head>
               <p>This description is entered as part of the element <gi>layoutDesc</gi> (Burnard
                  &amp; Bauman 2007). As in many other places in the model you can choose between
                  unstructured description (with element <gi>p</gi>) or structured data in the
                  element <gi>layout</gi>, probably preceded by an introduction (element
                     <gi>summary</gi>).</p>
               <p>The element <gi>layout</gi> has three special attributes: <att>columns</att>,
                     <att>writtenLines</att> and <att>ruledLines</att>. If there are no further
                  explanations by the encoder, all the information can be supplied through these
                  attribute values:</p>

               <head>Ink</head>
               <p>Information about the ink is presented usually as a simple phrase like “brown dark
                  ink for the basic text and red ink for the headings and small initials”. However,
                  such descriptions could then be further developed in order to supply information
                  on ink composition, or its brightness or its loss of colour. A simple description
                  could be:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <ink>Brown ink for the text and dark red for the initials</ink>

               <head>Decoration</head>
               <p>The element <gi>decoDesc</gi> is used to give information about manuscript
                  illumination. There are two basic ways of using this element and the sub-elements
                  of its structure. The first is to provide basic notions on the styles and art
                  objects in the codex with the help of the element <gi>p</gi> (paragraph). Another
                  way is to provide a thorough description of each kind of manuscript decoration
                  with the element <gi>decoNote</gi>, possibly preceded by some kind of introduction
                  (in the element <gi>summary</gi>). In the second approach each <gi>decoNote</gi>
                  is supplied with the attribute <att>type</att> and an appropriate value, e.g.,
                     <val>miniatures</val>, <val>headpieces</val>, <val>tail-pieces</val>,
                     <val>initials</val>, <val>borders</val>, <val>line-fillers</val>,

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>Information about binding in most of the descriptions is very brief, and
                     consists of statements like “Wooden panels covered with ornamented leathers.
                     Not original. Done probably in 16th century." In most cases this information is
                     entered in brief descriptions using the sub-element <gi>p</gi> of the element
                        <gi>bindingDesc</gi> (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007). The describer can
                     supplement this with further notes about the binding decoration
                        (<gi>decoDesc</gi>) and its recent condition (<gi>condition</gi>).</p>
                  <p>If the encoder prefers to use a structured description, a short statement
                     should be entered in the element <gi>binding</gi> as value of the attribute
                        <att>contemporary</att>, such as <val>true</val>, <val>false</val>,
                        <val>unknown</val>.</p>
                  <p>The encoder can include a short statement before continuing the description of
                     the binding, or he or she can provide only this information. In the latter case
                     he or she could give information about all of the main parts of the
                     book-binding structure and decoration. For example:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <bindingDesc>
                        <binding contemporary="true"><p>Brocade on wooden boards, <dimensions

                              The paste-downs and first and last flyleaves are backed with mauve
                              cloth. Illumination and marginalia have suffered a little from
                              excessive trimming. The edges of the pages are gauffred and gilded.
                              Two metal bosses on the lower side of each cover.</p>

                     </bindingDesc> (from the description of British library Ms Egerton 3045 by
                     Dilyana Radoslavova) </egXML>
                  <p>All other aspects of the binding description, not covered by elements like
                        <gi>decoDesc</gi> or <gi>condition</gi>, could be entered in the element
                        <gi>bindingNote</gi> with different values of the attributes <att>type</att>
                     or <att>subtype</att>. For example, all aspects of the description of the cover
                     should be entered in the content of the element <gi>bindingNote</gi> with
                     attribute <att>type</att> = <val>cover</val>. The material of the cover should
                     be then described as part of the sub-element <gi>material</gi>. The same is
                     true also for other parts of bookbinding, such as edges (e.g., technology,
                     beveling of edges), fly-leaves, etc. The observations in <gi>fastening</gi>
                     could include how the fastening is done, e.g., by peg and strap, by hook and
                     clasp; the length or width of the elements could be measured; their place(s)
                     could be described, etc. In <gi>furnishing</gi> the encoder should describe all
                     the bosses, corner pieces, etc. that can be observed on the binding.</p>
                  <p>A description of the sewing could include the types of attachments to the
                     quires and leaves or to the main boards. A text block can be sewn through the
                     side of the leaves, e.g., through as over sewing or side sewing, etc. In
                     addition, the text block can also be sewn through the fold of the sections by
                     hand. Three different patterns are observed: sewing structure, sewing stitches,
                     and sewing pattern:</p>
                  <p><term>Sewing structures</term>: supported = parts other than thread involved in
                     the connection of the sections. Materials for support usually are: cord,
                     parchment, skin, linen tape, etc. unsupported = only sewing thread connecting
                     the sections to each other. An unsupported structure is commonly found in
                     Greek, Islamic, and Oriental books.</p>
                  <p><term>Sewing stitches</term>, which is the motion of a thread from a sewing
                     station (hole) exit to a sewing station entry. The classification could be as
                     follows:</p>

                  <list rend="simple">
                     <item>Fold patterns: sequence of thread visible inside the fold of the section.
                        These are of two types: Continuous pattern: thread passing in and out each
                        sewing station to form a pattern; and Periodic pattern: thread skipping
                        sewing holes and leaves intervals between some of the stations.</item>
                     <item>Spine patterns: the pattern is formed by the stitches across the
                        uncovered spine of the book. Some spine patterns are: (1) Chain (formed by
                        link stitches), (2) Bridge (by span), (3) Ribs (by loop), (4) Herringbone
                        (by loop and link), (5) Steps (by lap), etc.</item>

                  <p>In most of the cases the binding of medieval manuscripts is latter then the

                     the <att>target</att> attribute value <val>notel</val>. As in all other cases
                     with the elements <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi>, such an identifier must be
                     present. Another possible solution is to use in this case the element
                        <gi>ptr</gi> instead of <gi>ref</gi>. The element <gi>ptr</gi> is an empty
                     element and all its information is encoded with attributes. This means that we
                     would have to omit, e.g., a bookbinder’s note, yielding something like:</p>

                  <p>There are several types of additional notes, some original to the manuscript,
                     that could be described in different ways. The first one, the colophon,
                     containing the name of the scribe, date and possibly place should be described
                     as part of the <gi>msItemStruct</gi> as stated below. Other notes go elsewhere.

                  <p>This is the most obvious place for the description of additions. The element

                     element. If there is just one addition, then the description and edition should
                     be ordered in the following order: <gi>locus</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
                     <gi>date</gi>. The description could consist of one or more paragraphs
                        (<gi>p</gi>) or it could be encoded as a <gi>list</gi> containing two or
                     more <gi>item</gi> elements. If there is just one note, the structure could be

            <div>
               <head>General remarks</head>
               <p>In the Repertorium Initiative approach all data about the palaeographic and
                  linguistic aspects of the manuscripts are gathered together under the element
                     <gi>scribeDesc</gi>. This element represents an information level between the
                  pure physical description of the manuscript and a description of its content. As
                  elsewhere in this electronic model, both unstructured and structured approaches
                  are available. The unstructured description means entering the information only as
                  part of paragraph (<gi>p</gi>) elements. The structured approach involves encoding
                  information about each scribe (element <gi>scribe</gi>), possibly preceded by an
                  overview (element <gi>summary</gi>). When the second approach is adopted, the
                  first elements to be entered are the name and the place in the manuscript where
                  the scribe has written it. If the name of the scribe is not available or unknown,
                  the encoder can record that as:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <scribeDesc>
                     <scribe n="1">
                        <name>Unknown</name> ... </scribe>
                  </scribeDesc>
               </egXML>
               <p>This information is followed by a description of palaeographic and linguistic
                  features, along with additional notes as needed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Palaeographical features</head>
               <p>The analysis of the palaeographical features of the manuscript should be
                  accomplished in the element <gi>palaeoCharact</gi>. The content of this element is
                  a combination of paragraph (<gi>p</gi>) elements with other elements specific for
                  the description of palaeography. This means that the encoder may enter either
                  unstructured or structured information, and under the latter approach such
                  features as musical notation or encrypted writing can be described with
                  specialized tags. The <gi>palaeoCharact</gi> element has one important attribute –
                     <att>script</att>. The value of this attribute should be short code that is
                  compatible with international standards of script designations (ISO 15924), e.g.,
                     <val>Grek</val> for Greek, <val>Cyrl</val> for Modern Cyrillic, <val>Cyrs</val>
                  for Old Cyrillic, <val>Latn</val> for Latin or <val>Glag</val> for Glagolitic
                  (http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html):</p>

               <p>A brief introduction to the palaeographical characteristics of the scribe can be

                     element <gi>musicNotation</gi>. The element has a special attribute
                        <att>type</att>, which could further systematize the notation:</p>

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>In the framework of Repertorium Initiative there is a clear distinction between
                     the language of the text and the language of the scribe. The language of the
                     text is understood in relation to the text history, cf. the section pertaining
                     to manuscript content. The language of the scribe or scribes may or may not be
                     related with the text history and text analysis. Therefore, a special section
                     in the manuscript description is need to allow it to be treated separately.</p>
                  <p>The language of the scribe can be described as unstructured paragraph
                        (<gi>p</gi>)elements or as a sequence of the elements <gi>orthography</gi>,
                        <gi>grammar</gi> and <gi>lexis</gi>, optionally introduced by general
                     observations in the element <gi>summary</gi>.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Orthography</head>
                  <p>Encoders of Slavonic manuscripts have two possible ways to describe
                     orthographic features. The first is to provide only a brief characteristic in
                     the element <gi>p</gi>, e.g.:</p>
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <orthography>
                        <p>The scribe writes with two jers and with nonetymological appearance of
                           juses. After the letters ш, ж, in the word-initial position (after j),
                           and after the vowel letters front nasal is turned into the back one.
                           After ч this change is not observed. A relatively small number of
                           ligatures and supralinear signs. A few examples of accent marks
                        ...</p></orthography>
                  </egXML>
                  <p>The other way to describe the orthography of the scribe is with a structured
                     description, where each piece of the description is entered as a separate
                     element.</p>
                  <div>
                     <head>The element <gi>orthNote</gi></head>
                     <p>The rules for the usage of different letters and signs are described as
                        content of the element <gi>orthNote</gi>. It contains the attributes
                           <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att>, which are used to typologize the
                        orthography of the scribe in appropriate ways, especially with respect to
                        three groups of letters: jers, juses and letters for jotated vowels.</p>
                     <div>
                        <head>The orthography of the jers</head>
                        <p>Information regarding this feature is entered in the element
                              <gi>orthNote</gi> with value of attribute <code>type="jer"</code>. The
                           encoder can describe the positions of jers and their relationship to the
                           etymological condition, along with examples of their usage. This element
                           has one required attribute: <att>subtype</att>. Possible values are:</p>

                           <item>irregular: the use of jers cannot be formalized in general

               <p>The content of the whole manuscript is described in the element
                     <gi>msContents</gi>. Nothing in this element is mandatory, but the element
                  itself is required, and the encoder might start by defining the range of texts in
                  terms of the research tradition. There are three special attributes for this
                  element. The first, <att>type</att>, can record whether the manuscript collection
                  of texts is original (<att>original</att>) or represents either an earlier
                  compilation or a translation. The second, <att>style</att>, can situate the
                  manuscript within a broad typology, viz., choosing between the values
                     <val>narrative</val> and <val>non-narrative</val>. The third, <att>class</att>,
                  can be used to provide a convenient typology for all the texts in the manuscript.
                  The usage of these three attributes with their values can be illustrated with this
                  example:</p>

                  modern books. Where it occurs, it is best to encode just the main information and
                  to give a link to the image of the page:</p>

               <head>The authors, editors and compilers of the text collection in the
                  manuscript</head>
               <p>In most cases manuscripts contain texts from different authors and their tradition
                  of edition and compilation could be very variable. There are, however, also
                  codices that contain more or less a fixed collection of texts by or attributed to
                  a single author. In such cases, such as the Pandects of Antiochus, Pandects of
                  Nikon of Montenegro or Chrysorrhoas collection with writings of John Chrysostom
                  (Thomson 1982; Miltenov 2010; Милтенов 2011) we can provide information about the
                  author and sometimes about the editor/compiler of the whole set of texts, as in
                  this example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  </respStmt> From the electronic description of MS Rila 3/6 by Anisava Miltenova </egXML>
               <p>Here we have three kinds of information: 1) about the original author of the texts
                  (John Chrysostom), 2) about the translator of his works (monk Antonij), and 3)
                  about the compiler of this miscellany (Vladislav Gramatik). All the information
                  other than authorship is contained in the element <gi>respStmt</gi>, which has two
                  parts: (1)<gi>resp</gi> (responsibility), here a brief statement in the form of
                  words as <code>editor</code>, <code>compiler</code>, <code>scribe</code>, etc.,
                  could be made, and (2) information about the person in elements <gi>name</gi> or
                     <gi>persName</gi> (personal name, cf. Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007:

               <head>A note in the description of texts</head>
               <p>The element <gi>note</gi> in the description of texts is restricted to cases that
                  deal with extra-textual historical features, such as missing parts of the
                  texts:</p>

               <p>Here, a reference to the physical condition of the manuscript is given. In other
                  cases the element <gi>note</gi> could be useful to further refine the text
                  attribution of the whole codex and/or to provide bibliographic data:</p>

               <head>Information about text history for the whole manuscript</head>
               <p>The text historical information on the level of the whole manuscripts is part of
                  the content of the series of element <gi>filiation</gi>. This element has one
                  important attribute, <att>type</att>, the most common values of which are :</p>
               <p><val>antigraph</val>: information about the text collection’s antigraph</p>
               <p><val>apograph</val>: information about the text collection’s apograph</p>
               <p><val>litRedaction</val>: information about the textual redaction or recension of
                  the whole manuscript</p>
               <p><val>protograph</val>: information about the text collection’s protograph</p>
               <p><val>source</val>: the source of the whole text collection</p>
               <p><val>translation:</val> data about the translation with respect to number and/or
                  origin.</p>
               <p>Examples of usage are given below. On the level of the whole manuscript these
                  features are invoked only when conclusions can be drawn for the whole text
                  collection about a common source, protograph, literary redaction, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The original text on the level of the whole manuscript</head>
               <p>Some collections of texts have a common title or heading, incipit and explicit. In
                  this cases, the element <gi>sampleText</gi> could be used. In all other cases the
                  element <gi>sampleText</gi> should be used to illustrate particular texts from the
                  manuscripts, rather than the whole body of the codex.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The characterization of each text</head>
               <p>Information about each individual text resembles closely the description of the
                  whole text collection. All features of such a description are given as part of the
                  element <gi>msItemStruct</gi> (a structured manuscript item, Burnard &amp; Bauman
                  2007: msItemStruct). This element has the same three attributes, with the same
                  functions, as <gi>msContents</gi>: <att>type</att>, <att>style</att> and
                     <att>class</att>. In addition to these attributes it may be convenient to use
                  unique identifier for each text as part of the XML document (attribute
                     <att>xml:id</att>), as well as perhaps <att>defective</att> with one of the
                  values: <val>true</val>, <val>false</val>, <val>unknown</val>,
                     <val>inapplicable</val>. In the Repertorium framework the value of the
                     <att>xml:id</att> in <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is a combination of the fixed string
                     <val>ACD</val> (abbreviation for <code>Article Content Description</code>) and
                  the place number of the text in order in the manuscript. A combination of all of
                  the important attributes of <gi>msItemStruct</gi> can be illustrated by this
                  hypothetical example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct defective="false" type="compilation" style="non-narrative"
                     xml:id="ACD1"> ... </msItemStruct>

            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The text location</head>
               <p>The exact place of the text in the manuscript is given as part of the element
                     <gi>locus</gi>. In the Repertorium we use this element together with the
                  attribute <att>n</att> (number) to represent the number of a text as part of a
                  whole text collection:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <locus n="1">1r-25v</locus>
               </egXML>
               <p>The contents of the element here is the exact ordinal location in the manuscript
                  where the text is to be found.</p>
               <p>When the one and same text is dispersed across different parts of manuscript a
                     <gi>locusGrp</gi> element is used:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <locusGrp n="7">
                     <locus n="7.1">154r-155v</locus>
                     <locus n="7.2">90r-90v</locus>
                  </locusGrp> From the electronic description of MS NBKM 309 by Anisava Miltenova </egXML>
               <p>In this example the text is falsely reordered in two different places in the
                  manuscript, so that the beginning part of the text is bound after the ending part.
                  In such cases it is mandatory to give the exact order of the leaves. The attribute
                     <att>n</att> gives here the exact number of the text (7), which is restored to
                  logical order with the help of sub-numbers (7.1 and 7.2).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The name of the text given by the researcher</head>
               <p>In the approach of Repertorium Initiative, there is a strict distinction between
                  text supplied by the researcher (the so-called “scientific title" or "supplied
                  title") and the original title of a text as it appears in the manuscript copy.
                  Both are important, the original text because it is part of the archaeographic
                  object and the scientific title because it enables researchers to identify and
                  attribute texts consistently, even when the titles may be spelled differently in
                  different manuscripts.</p>
               <p>Consider the following example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD6" style="narrative" type="translation">

                     <title lang="en">Interpretation of the Acts of Apostles. </title>
                     <author>St. Hyppolitus of Rome. </author>
                     <note>Interpretation on the 9th Proverb: “Wisdom has built her house".</note>
                     <filiation type="source" subtype="Greek"><bibl>Migne, PG 10, col.
                           952-953</bibl></filiation>
                     <filiation type="translation"><num>1?</num></filiation>
                     <filiation type="protograph">Bulgarian</filiation> ... </msItemStruct>
               </egXML>
               <p>If the title were just transferred automatically from the original text of the
                  manuscript, the text would read “About the 12 Apostles. Where each of them
                  preached". Such a title would not make it possible to identify other copies of the
                  same text, where the heading in those other manuscripts will probably be
                  different, and it would also not be possible to compare this text with its Greek
                  source. In this case the element <gi>title</gi> should provide a standardized
                  title that is compatible with other Slavonic and non-Slavonic traditions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The author of the text</head>
               <p>The name of the author of the text is given as content of the element
                     <gi>author</gi>. This element contains the name of the author of the text as
                  attributed by the encoder, and it may not agree with the name of an alleged author
                  included in the manuscript itself. The usage of this element and as well as the
                  element <gi>respStmt</gi> is exactly as the illustrated as part of the element
                     <gi>msContents</gi> above.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Special data related to the text</head>
               <p>Data about the text not directly related to the text tradition but nonetheless
                  important for a full description may be encoded as part of the content of the
                  element <gi>note</gi> inside <gi>msItemStruct</gi>. In the example given above,
                  the content of this element is:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <note>Interpretation on the 9th Proverb: “Wisdom has built her house"</note>
               </egXML>
               <p>In this example, the element’s content explains the title given by the researcher.
                  Without the knowledge that this fragment is part of a larger text, which has its
                  own tradition, it would be impossible to undertake further steps in the
                  investigation. This element may also be used to explain text losses and
                  interpolations, which may provide keys to understanding the textual tradition.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Dates for texts sung or read on particular occasions</head>
               <p>As part of the same element <gi>note</gi> inside the <gi>msItemStruct</gi> element
                  we could enter fixed or movable dates presented in the manuscript copy or known by
                  the encoder in comparison with other sources. Consider the following example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <p>Here we have all possible information about this date in the <emph>Codex
                     Suprasliensis</emph>. The commemoration of St. John the Hesychast in this
                  manuscript is on March 31, formalized as <code>03-31</code>. The date is used in
                  the church calendar (<code>type="church"</code>), it is presented in the
                  manuscript (internal, i.e., not supplied or conjectured by the encoder) and is

               <head>The language of the text</head>
               <p>Unlike the element <gi>scribeLang</gi>, which is intended to give information
                  about the language of the scribe and of the manuscript parts, <gi>textLang</gi>
                  can provide material for the linguistic analysis of the textological features of a
                  particular text.</p>
               <p>Consider the example:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               </egXML>
               <p>This observation could lead to closer comparison of this text with other parts of
                  the contents, and may help determine whether its origin is different from

            <div>
               <head>The text source</head>
               <p>Usually the source in the Slavonic tradition is a Greek or Latin original text
                  that served as the source of translation. In the example above the excerpt:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <p>does not mean that the given text is a direct source for the translation, but that

               <p>A comparison of different copies of one and the same text may lead to interesting
                  results. For example MS NBKM 309 and MS Slav. Dujčev 17 share almost the same
                  content, the latter manuscript being the copy of the former. During restoration
                  the content of the MS NBKM 309 was rearranged, leading to disordered folia. As a
                  result the content of both is now best described by comparison (Милтенова 1989).
                  In the process of electronic cataloguing the contents of the both manuscripts have
                  been reconstructed as part of the process of identifying a possible common
                  ancestor. In electronic form this task could be fulfilled by attribute values in
                  elements <gi>msItemStruct</gi> and <gi>locus</gi>. In both manuscript descriptions
                     <att>xml:id</att> begins with value <val>ACD1</val>. However, the values of the
                  attribute <att>n</att> on the element <gi>locus</gi> differ. The first text in MS
                  NBKM 309 is:</p>

               </egXML>
               <p>The same text in the description of Slav Dujčev 17 has the same number in
                     <gi>locus</gi> but comes in the second place:</p>

               <p>In both manuscripts the first item from the reconstructed cycle is missing, and
                  therefore an element <gi>locus</gi> with <code>n="1"</code> is absent as well.</p>
               <p>Thus, we can have three different points of view about the place of a particular
                  text: 1) as part of the manuscript; 2) as part of the content shared with another
                  manuscript, and 3) as part of the reconstructed cycle of texts.</p>

                     <gi>decoDesc</gi> and with the same XML content as <gi>msItemStruct</gi>. This
                  could be especially convenient in cases when the manuscript copy is compared with
                  other copies of the same text, which could lead to conclusions about specific text
                  formation and layout.</p>

               <p>In this example the main text is called „Physiologus" and it contains more than 40
                  small stories. The first one is „About the lion". The numbers and identifiers are
                  set in such a way that it is possible from their value to see the text hierarchy
                  (cf. values ACD15 and ACD15.1). Every text could have its own standardized title,
                  as given by the research tradition, along with its own incipit and/or explicit, as
                  found in the manuscript (cf. also Стойкова 2011).</p>

               <p>The location of the manuscript date and place in the description differs across
                  descriptive models. The deviations are caused not by the particular research
                  culture (e.g., Byzantine Greek, Slavonic, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, or Hebrew),
                  but, rather, by the more general assumptions of local traditions. Very often the
                  date of a manuscript is represented as part of the heading of the description,
                  together with the place of origin and its name. In the Repertorium framework
                  historical information about a manuscript is unified within the element
                     <gi>history</gi>.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Date and place of origin of the manuscript</head>
               <p>This element could contain a short overview of the history of the manuscript in
                  the form of one or more paragraphs (element <gi>p</gi>) or it could contain a
                  structured description of its origin, provenance and acquisition in a library or
                  archive, possibly introduced by some kind of summary (element <gi>summary</gi>).
                  The original date and place of the manuscript are containing in the element
                     <gi>origin</gi>:</p>

                  and place of origin. Additionally we can provide the attribute <att>cert</att>
                  with a value such as, for example, <val>high</val>, which means that we believe
                  that the data in manuscript is the true one. Other possible values of
                     <att>cert</att> are <val>low</val>, <val>medium</val> or

               <p>Somewhere at the beginning of the physical description should be a short statement
                  about the fact that the manuscript in question is a palimpsest. Sections about
                  manuscript cataloguing, history, etc. are almost always common for all data with
                  one exception: the original dates of writing and places of origin differ, and this
                  information should be provided explicitly. In cases involving restoration and
                  references there could be a need for additional data sets. Parts are further

                  formed from paper and are defined not in terms of layers, but as a horizontal
                  sequence of parts.</p>

               <p>In principle, convolutes do not require special manuscript names or shelfmarks.
                  They do, however, require a special section pointing to the place(s) where the
                  parts are to be found. In the example above the element <gi>locus</gi> fulfills
                  this role.</p>

               <p>A description of the content applies to all parts together, and begins with

               <head>Divisions</head>
               <p>In the TEI approach there are two ways to structure a given text at a high level:
                  numbered and unnumbered text divisions. The Repertorium uses only the latter
                  approach. In the description of manuscripts in the Repertorium project the element
                     <gi>div</gi> is used only in cases when an unknown or rare text or text variant
                  is discovered and merits inclusion as a preliminary edition.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Paragraphs</head>
               <p>Paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) may appear in various places in the
                  description—essentially anywhere where there is not enough data for a structured
                  description or where such a description is otherwise unnecessary or undesirable. A
                  possible example might be paragraphs in the element <gi>condition</gi>, where
                  different types of damage or loss could be grouped together, as in this example
                  from the description of <emph>Codex Suprasliensis</emph>:</p>
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <condition>
                     <p xml:id="missedparts">The beginning and the end of Ljubljana part are
                        missing. Two leaves have been lost from the middle of the Vita of St Paul
                        the Simple, after f. 86v. There are lacunae between ff.78v-79r, 84v-85r.</p>
                     <p xml:id="replacements">f. 38 (containing part of the Vita of SS Terentius,
                        Africanus and Pompius) is bound in the wrong place and should be read after

                        trimmed during the restoration of this part of the MS, with the result that
                        the parts that are now in Saint Petersburg and Warsaw are slightly larger
                           (<dimensions unit="mm" type="folia"><height>313</height>

               <head>Bibliographies and references</head>
               <p>Bibliographies provide a choice between one simple bibliographical reference
                  (element <gi>bibl</gi>) and a list of such references (element <gi>listBibl</gi>).
                  Both elements are described in TEI Guidelines (Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007). In the
                  Repertorium framework neither of these should contain a full bibliographical
                  record; Repertorium practice is that these elements contain only pointers to full
                  bibliographic information, which is encoded at the end of a description or, when
                  the description is part of the larger project, in а separate file.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>The Repertorium Initiative provides detailed, structured additions to the TEI XML
               manuscript description model. It complements the TEI model in some parts through the
               rearrangement of known elements, the addition of new ones, and the extension of the
               base of specialized attributes, all with an eye toward intra-project consistency and
               support for particular details of the Slavonic philological tradition.</p>
