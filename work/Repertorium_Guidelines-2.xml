               <p>These Guidelines are the first complete introduction to the Repertorium Initiative
                  XML model for the electronic description of medieval manuscripts. The model is
                  part of the activity of the <orgName>Special Commission for Computer Processing of
                     Medieval Slavonic Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</orgName> to the
                  Executive Board of the International Committee of Slavists. This version of the
                  Guidelines differs significantly from all previous versions in both form and
                  content. The most important new feature is the synchronization with the “P5:
                  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange” of the Text Encoding
                  Initiative Consortium (TEI) XML. We have retained differences between the TEI and
                  the Repertorium manuscript description models in situations where it was necessary
                  to extend the TEI resources, but we have made every effort to bring two as close
                  as possible, taking into consideration primarily the three principal medieval
                  manuscript traditions in Europe: Slavic, Greek, and Latin. We hope that the result
                  will contribute to further discussion of how to encode a manuscript description in
                  electronic form. An Appendix to this text explains and discusses remaining
                  differences between the TEI and Repertorium schemas and guidelines.</p>
               <p>This edition has been rewritten completely, and is not based directly on earlier
                  attempts to document the Repertorium XML model. It contains many editorial
                  changes, new examples, revised lists of elements and attributes, and discussions
                  about a wide variety of topics.</p>
               <p>Previous versions of these Guidelines circulated only in electronic form. The
                  first was compiled for the Annual TEI Members’ Meeting in 2005 in Sofia.
                  Subsequently, within the framework of the project <orgName>Slovo: Toward a Digital
                     Library of South Slavic Manuscripts</orgName> (2007–08, cf. Miklas and
                  Miltenova 2008), funded by the Austrian Science and Liaison Offices, a new
                  electronic version was prepared. Both are now archived and available on request.
                  The present, new Guidelines are based on the ideas and proposals contained in
                  various project papers, proceedings and special volumes (Birnbaum and Miltenova
                  2000, esp. Miltenova and Bojadžiev 2000, Bojadžiev 2000, Dobreva 2000, Stojkova
                  2000, Radoslavova 2000; Miltenova et al. 2003, esp. Cleminson 2003, Bojadžiev et
                  al. 2003, Moussakova 2003, Krushelnitskaya 2003; Miklas and Miltenova 2008, cf.
                  Birnbaum et. al. 1995; Cleminson 1998; Gagova 1998, 2000; Radoslavova 1998;
                  Stoykova 1998), as well as in the Commission’s journal
                  <title level="j">Scripta &amp; e-Scripta</title> (e.g., Miltenova 2008; Boyadzhiev
                  2009). These ideas have also been presented and discussed at several conferences
                  and workshops. It goes without saying that this published document can reflect
                  only the current level of our work and the model may undergo further changes, but
                  we consider the present version representative of a stable stage in the
                  development of the Repertorium schema that has been used effectively in
                  production.</p>

               <head>About this document</head>
               <p>This document is provided as an introduction to the XML model for the description
                  of Medieval Manuscripts known as the Repertorium Initiative or Template for Slavic
                  Manuscripts (TSM). It is intended for those who have some previous knowledge of
                  XML technologies and who would like to begin to describe medieval manuscripts. It
                  should not be considered a general introduction to markup technologies, nor a
                  tutorial on the TEI approach to linguistic and literary markup. For the latter,
                  see the fifth chapter of the current P5 edition of the TEI Guidelines
                  <title level="a">A gentle introduction to XML</title> (Burnard and Bauman
                  2007).</p>

               <p>Although I can not possibly do justice to everyone who has provided useful
                  comments on or changes to the XML model described in these Guidelines, or by
                  editing and proofreading various passages of the text, I owe special thanks to the
                  following for their patience and courage: David J. Birnbaum, Ralph Cleminson,

               <head>Short history</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative started during 1994–95 as <orgName>Computer-Supported
                     Processing of Medieval Slavic Manuscripts</orgName>, an international project
                  with coordinators Prof. David J. Birnbaum (University of Pittsburgh) and Dr.
                  Anisava Miltenova (Institute of Literature, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences). The
                  project was supported by a grant from the International Research and Exchanges
                  Board (IREX), Washington, DC. During this period an initial SGML model was
                  developed by David J. Birnbaum, Anisava Miltenova, Milena Dobreva (Institute of
                  Mathematics and Informatics, BAS, Bulgaria), Berend Dijk, and Harry Gaylord (both
                  from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands). Further work on defining
                  content models, especially for textological, linguistic and palaeographical
                  features, was implemented in 1995 by David J. Birnbaum, Anisava Miltenova, and
                  Andrej Bojadžiev.</p>
               <p>During the next three years (1996–98) the project continued as a joint initiative
                  under the guidance of Prof. Ralph Cleminson (Central European University
                  [Budapest, Hungary] and the University of Portsmouth [UK]) and Dr. Anisava
                  Miltenova, with the name <orgName>Computer Supported Processing of Medieval Slavic
                     Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</orgName> (a joint project supported by
                  Central European University). At this time more than one hundred manuscript
                  descriptions were encoded electronically and the project gained in popularity
                  among scholars.</p>
               <p>At the Twelfth International Congress of Slavists in 1998 in Kraków the need for
                  markup technologies and standards and the lack of unified and well-established
                  terminology in the field of Slavic Medieval Studies became obvious, and a new
                     <orgName>Commission for the Computer Processing of Medieval Slavonic
                     Manuscripts and Early Printed Books</orgName> was chartered by the Executive
                  Board of the International Committee of Slavists (Miltenova et al. 1998). Members
                  of the Commission are scholars from more than twelve countries and the main
                  function of the Commission is to serve as a coordinator among projects in the
                  field.</p>
               <p>In 1999–2000 the TEI P3 SGML model was transferred to TEI P4 XML syntax by David
                  J. Birnbaum. The team decided then to change not only the markup language, but
                  also the declarations of some elements and attributes, both to improve the overall
                  structure and to enhance the functionality of the schema. This stage of
                  development was completed in 2001–02. Since then the minor changes and
                  improvements that have been made to the model are, in most cases, backwards
                  compatible. An experimental Repertorium Workstation database was build on the
                  eXist-db native XML database (<ptr target="https://exist-db.org"/>) by David J.
                  Birnbaum (Birnbaum 2009). It uses SVG technology to support the graphic
                  representation of textological differences and similarities.</p>
               <p>This model was presented at conferences in Bulgaria, France, Greece, the
                  Netherlands, Poland, and the USA. Additionally, participants in the Repertorium
                  project conducted courses, lectures, and workshops about the Repertorium in
                  Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, and the USA, .</p>

               <head>Sources for the XML model</head>
               <p>The Repertorium model relies fully on structured markup technologies. The first
                  variant was implemented in 1994–95 as an SGML Document Type Definition (ISO
                  8859:1987), based on TEI P3. The model presented here is based on Extensible
                  Markup Language (XML), a simplified and web-oriented variant of SGML, and
                  specifically on the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI) P5 schemas. The
                  Repertorium model reflects fifteen years of electronic philological descriptions
                  of more than three hundred Slavic medieval and early modern manuscripts.</p>
               <p>From the beginning, the Repertorium manuscript description model, initially called
                  the Template for Slavic Manuscripts (TSM), was based closely on the ideas of the
                  Text Encoding Initiative and the schema fragments used there (TEI). The current
                  Repertorium Initiative XML model for manuscript description is designed as a
                  customization of top of TEI P5, implemented with by means of a TEI ODD
                  customization file. For the publication of Repertorium manuscript descriptions in
                  electronic form, the project relies on XQuery and XSLT scripts that transform the
                  input XML to XML, XHTML, and SVG.</p>

               <head>The Text Encoding Initiative Consortium and the Repertorium</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative uses the TEI models as a principal framework for
                  encoding and interchange. However, the Repertorium model extends some of the TEI
                  element and attribute definitions, thus providing opportunities for the encoder to
                  describe fully specific features of medieval Slavonic texts. Simultaneously with
                  our work, the TEI Consortium published its own model for manuscript description,
                  which is based primarily on the MASTER project, a European Initiative for the
                  description of Western European manuscripts. The principal differences between the
                  Repertorium and TEI models are described in full in appendices to these
                  Guidelines, along with formal definitions of Repertorium-specific additions and
                  other changes to the TEI P5 models.</p>

            <head>Standards and recommendations implied in TEI P5</head>
            <p>Like other projects built on top of TEI P5 by means of ODD, the Repertorium 3.0 model
               can be represented in schemas in XML 1.0 DTD (Bray et al. 2008), Relax NG (Clark,
               Murata 2001, Clark 2002), and W3C Schema (Shudi, Sperberg, Thomson 2009, Peterson et
               al. 2009). From TEI P5 the Repertorium inherits the possibility of using all modern
               standards technologies from the XML family, including, for example, XSLT, XML
               namespaces (Bray et al. 2006), XQuery (Boag et al. 2011), XML Base (Marsh, Tobin
               2009), and others.</p>
            <p>Repertorium 3.0 inherits all constructions in the syntax of attribute values from the
               TEI P5 infrastructure, where they are, in turn, expressed according to
               recommendations of the W3 Consortium and ISO standards, and various RFCs and BCPs.
               The attribute values for language codes follow BCP 47 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which
               comprises RFC 4646 (Philips, Davis 2006a) and RFC 4647 (Philips, Davis 2006c), which,
               in turn, follow ISO standards (cf. ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2). Four-letter codes for the
               names of scripts are from ISO 15924 (ISO 15924). Data in attributes that provide
               pointers to other locations in the same or in other documents (e.g.,
                  <att>target</att> or <att>lemmaRef</att>) should be expressed in terms of RFC 3986
               (Berners-Lee et al 2005). Temporal expressions in attributes follow the W3C XML
               Schema recommendation or ISO 8601 (cf. Shudi, Sperberg, Thomson 2009, Peterson et al
               2009, ISO 8601).</p>
            <div>
               <head>Visualization and publication</head>
               <p>Previous versions of the Repertorium use the XLink recommendation (DeRose et al.
                  2000) and CSS techniques (Bos et al. 2008) to visualize XML data directly without
                  transformation. In the current version this approach has been abandoned in favour
                  of transformation to XHTML (Altheim, McCarron 2001) and possibly to PDF through
                  XSLT and XSL-FO scripts. TEI P5 versions are managed with an XSL framework (made
                  available by Sebastian Rahtz) which can be further customized to meet the needs of
                  a particular project.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Public identifier and XML namespaces</head>
               <p>Until now the Repertorium Initiative has had no Public Identifier (PI), and
                  instead used system identifiers (SI) and XML catalog files (cf. Bray et al. 2008,
                  Walsh 2001). Beginning with the current version of the Repertorium guidelines, the
                  following PI will be used: <code>-// Repertorium//DTD Repertorium XML
                     V3.0/EN</code>.</p>
               <p>For use with modern schema languages an XML Namespace designation is needed, and
                  we use <code>http://www.ilit.bas.bg/repertorium/ns/3.0</code>. All elements
                  defined by the TEI in the TEI namespace preserve their value despite the fact that
                  their content could be changed in some way, and only elements that are not present
                  in the TEI models are implemented in the Repertorium namespace.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The modules</head>
               <p>The Repertorium Initiative was intended from the ground up to be constructed as a
                  model for the description of medieval Slavic manuscripts. However in its XML
                  implementation it also has the ability to serve as a framework for the description
                  of other medieval traditions, such as Greek or Latin, because the philological
                  approaches for such investigations are much more similar than different. The
                  structures of catalogues of medieval European manuscripts share most of the same
                  features and should give answers to the same questions related to manuscript
                  contents, palaeography, and codicology.</p>
               <p>Using the TEI infrastructure makes it possible to implement several parts of an
                  electronic text project within the same model. For example, it becomes possible to
                  express all imaginable aspects of text edition, source description, and graphical
                  representation of a text object, providing ready-to-use models at least in the
                  following areas:</p>
               <list rend="simple">
                  <item>description of the source (in our case, a manuscript) edition of the text
                     (with the appropriate segmentation into separate text units, apparatus
                     criticus, annotation of linguistic features, pointers to graphical
                     representations of the original source, etc.)</item>
                  <item>encoding bibliographic records related to description and edition</item>
                  <item>encoding metadata, including terms of use</item>
                  <item>construction of a model of a print dictionary</item>
                  <item>technical documentation of the XML infrastructure (model classes, elements,
                     entities, attributes, etc.)</item>
               </list>
               <p>The TEI model that has served as the foundation for the Repertorium schema is
                  designed specifically to support the description of medieval manuscripts. The
                  required modules are:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item><ident>tei</ident> – the main module of the TEI Infrastructure (Burnard,

               <p>In addition to these required modules, several optional ones have been

                  <item><ident>figures</ident> – representation of tables, formulae, figures and

               <head>Some principles</head>
               <p>It was necessary to make a very precise comparison between the TEI P5 module for
                  manuscript description and the Repertorium model in order to reach the maximum
                  level of compatibility and interchangeability. To fulfill this task several
                  principles were formulated to govern the transformation of the prior Repertorium
                  schema into the present one:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>All attributes and elements from the <ident>core</ident> and additional tag
                     sets that have been changed from TEI P4 to TEI P5 have been changed in
                     Repertorium 3.0, as well.</item>
                  <item>All attributes and elements that share the same functionality between TEI P5
                     and Repertorium have been renamed in favor of TEI P5.</item>
                  <item>No customizations are made on the level of TEI macro structures or on the
                     level of model classes, with two exceptions: model classes related to specific
                     manuscript description element and the exclusion of all numbered
                        <ident>divLike</ident> models and their corresponding elements. This
                     includes removal of <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>, <gi>div3</gi>, <gi>div4</gi>,
                        <gi>div5</gi>, <gi>div6</gi>, and <gi>div7</gi>.</item>
                  <item>When there is an element with the same name and a compatible content model
                     in TEI P5 and the Repertorium, it is declared in the TEI, not the Repertorium,
                     namespace, even if the given element name originated in an earlier version of
                     the Repertorium Initiative, prior to its introduction into TEI P5.</item>
                  <item><!-- What does this mean? -->When there is no functional possibility in the
                     Repertorium model to express particular features, the elements from TEI P5 with
                     their names are taken without further customization. This is the case, for
                     example, with the element <gi>additional</gi>.</item>
                  <item>When the same information with the same functional characteristics was
                     expressed in different places in TEI P5 and the Repertorium, the Repertorium
                     model has been changed to match the TEI. This is the case, for example, with
                     the definition of manuscript origin. In early versions of the Repertorium
                     schema this was expressed with a <gi>manuscriptCreation</gi> element, placed
                     before the content description. However, in TEI P5 there is an element
                        <gi>origin</gi> with a similar function, which is part of the manuscript
                     history, placed almost at the end of the schema. In this case the Repertorium
                     model has been changed to agree with TEI P5.</item>
                  <item>When elements with different names share the same functional characteristics
                     even if their declarations differ to some extent, the elements from the TEI
                     namespace have been chosen. This is the case, for example, with the element
                        <gi>msItemStruct</gi>, which replaces the original Repertorium
                        <gi>articleContentDesc</gi>, and the element <gi>filiation</gi> with the
                     attribute <att>type</att>, which replaces earlier Repertorium
                        <gi>antigraph</gi>, <gi>apograph</gi>, <gi>litRedaction</gi>,
                        <gi>protograph</gi>, <gi>source</gi>, and <gi>translation</gi>
                     elements.</item>
                  <item>If one of the models provides a more general and simpler view and the other
                     has a structured model of the same information, an attempt has been made to
                     integrate both approaches into the declaration of element. This is the case,
                     for example, with <gi>bindingDesc</gi>. The declaration of this element in TEI
                     P5 is:
                        <eg><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT bindingDesc ((%model.pLike; | decoNote | condition)+ | binding+)>]]></eg>
                     The content of <gi>binding</gi> has been declared as
                        <eg><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT binding (%model.pLike; | condition | decoNote)+>]]></eg>
                     The proposed model leaves the declaration of <gi>bindingDesc</gi> without
                     changes but modifies the content of the element <gi>binding</gi> to include
                     structured information:
                        <eg><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT binding (%model.pLike; | bindingNote |condition | decoNote)>]]></eg></item>
                  <item>If there is an element in the Repertorium that has the same name as in TEI
                     P5 but a different meaning, the Repertorium element has been removed or
                     renamed. An example of such an element is <gi>writing</gi>, which was used in
                     earlier Repertorium schemas to provide general palaeographic information.
                     Because an element with the same name now exists in P5 with a completely
                     different meaning (<q>a passage of written text revealed to participants in the
                        course of a spoken text</q>, cf. Burnard and Bauman 2007), the Repertorium
                     element has been renamed <gi>summary</gi>.</item>
                  <item>Specific Repertorium elements and structures from earlier versions are
                     retained only if there are structural or semantic differences between the
                     Repertorium and TEI models. One example is the element <gi>scribeDesc</gi>,
                     which represent different points of view for manuscript description and is
                     presented in a different way by the TEI P5 Guidelines.</item>
                  <item>If in the TEI P5 Guidelines an element can be used with more than one
                     meaning, an attempt has been made to clarify the usage. This pertains, for
                     example, to elements such as <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, <gi>altIdentifier</gi>,
                        <gi>msPart</gi> and <gi>accMat</gi>.</item>

            <head>The main structure</head>
            <p>A manuscript description can occur in two different places in a Repertorium XML
               document. When the description (cataloguing information) serves as an introduction to
               the digital representation of transcribed text, it is encoded inside the
                  <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, where it provides metadata for the edition itself.
               However, when the goal of the project is focused on manuscript descriptions, without
               transcribed full text, the descriptive elements and content are regarded as primary
               data and the description itself becomes a primary object. In this case it serves no
               longer as metadata and must be entered instead as part of the content of the element
                  <gi>body</gi>.</p>
            <p>The basic, wrapper element for a description is <gi>msDesc</gi> (<gloss>manuscript
                  description</gloss>), which serves as a container for seven additional
               subcomponents: general cataloguing information (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>); headings
                  (<gi>head</gi>); information on physical characteristics and layout of the
               manuscript (<gi>physDesc</gi>); palaeographic and linguistic data
                  (<gi>scribeDesc</gi>); the description of the manuscript content as a whole, as
               separate texts, with any notes and colophon (<gi>msContents</gi>); conclusions about
               the time and place of writing of the manuscript and a sketch of the manuscript’s
               history (<gi>history</gi>); and a place for additional information the describer may
               need to include (<gi>additional</gi>). The only obligatory child of <gi>msDesc</gi>
               is <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. All other main elements are optional.</p>
            <p>Parts of convolutes and layers of palimpsests are represented by <gi>msPart</gi>
               elements. Additional notes by the authors of earlier descriptions and by owners of
               the manuscript form part of the element <gi>accMat</gi> (<gloss>accompanying
                  material</gloss>). The specification of the source could be extended further as
               part of the <gi>recordHist</gi> (<gloss>recorded history</gloss>) element at the end
               of the description (cf. Additional information).</p>
            <p>Information is entered step by step, in an ordered and purposeful way. The first step
               concerns general cataloguing information; then comes information related to physical
               features of the manuscript, palaeography, language, content, sources of manuscript
               description; and, finally, administrative information, such as custodial history,
               restoration, available photocopies, and bibliographic information.</p>

               <head>Levels of representation</head>
               <p>Descriptions of medieval manuscripts may differ significantly in both length and
                  structure. There are many competing or overlapping traditions in cataloguing
                  medieval materials, which means that similar information may look different and be
                  represented differently in different frameworks. The first thing to consider is
                  the completeness and length of the description.</p>

                  <p>In this more detailed version we attach the attribute <att>type</att> to the
                     element <gi>head</gi> to make a distinction between the proper headings in some
                     editions and the heading that serves as a brief statement here, and we tag each
                     identifiable type of information with appropriate TEI elements. One rationale
                     for using this more complete approach would be a need to extract or search for
                     specific types of data, or to format different types of data differently during
                     rendering. Like TEI P5, the Repertorium model supports both sparsely and richly
                     tagged information, with the degree of detail determined by the requirements of
                     the individual project.</p>

                  <p>In this example the cataloguing model consists of the identification of the

                     provides information that is typed with the help of <att>xml:id</att>. The
                     choice of paragraph types can be determined by the goals of the individual
                        project.<note>For example, <att>xml:id</att> attributes must be unique in an
                        XML document instance, so the use of that attribute for typing would not be
                        appropriate in situations where a single XML document contains multiple

                  <p>Another way to obtain information in the form of a checklist or short catalogue
                     is to extract already existing data from a richer analytical description. For
                     this purpose, the form of the full-length catalogue must follow encoding rules
                     that will allow data extraction without loss of information. For example, small
                     summaries or overviews might coexist with more elaborated, structured features
                     of manuscript or text analysis, as in the following excerpt from an electronic
                     description of NBKM 848 by Margaret Dimitrova:

                     permits the use of XSLT or XQuery to extract whatever information might be
                     needed, from just the summary (for use in a short catalogue or shelflist) to
                     more specific details (for comparison or other types of analysis).</p>

               <p>Cataloguing information is an obligatory part of each manuscript description and

               <list rend="simple">
                  <item>identification of manuscript name, as a type or genre (e.g., <hi
                        rend="italic">Menaion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Triodion</hi>) or as a
                     specific name that has become standardized in the research tradition (e.g., <hi
                        rend="italic">Euchologium Sinaiticum</hi>);</item>
                  <item>information about where the manuscript is kept, together with its

                  <item>optional additional notes</item>
               </list>
               <p>The description thus begins with answers to questions like: What is the name of
                  the manuscript? Where it is now kept? Are there earlier descriptions? The answers
                  to all of these questions constitute part of the content of the element
                     <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (<gloss>manuscript identifier</gloss>, Burnard and Bauman
                  2007). The encoder can provide information about the name of the manuscript
                     (<gi>msName</gi>), if it exists, and about the country, city or other
                  geographical region, and the institution, repository, or collection where the
                  manuscript can be found (Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                     <ident>model.placeNamePart</ident>). Between <gi>msName</gi> and following
                  structured information it is possible to insert a brief summary description in the
                  form of paragraph (cf. below). More information, including optional bibliographic
                  records or lists of records, may be entered as part of the element
                  <gi>note</gi>.</p>
               <p>The element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> (manuscript identifier) has <att>type</att> and
                     <att>subtype</att> attributes. These attributes may be used, for example, when
                  the manuscript is now lost or its place is now unknown, so that the type of
                  identifier is not current, and the electronic form represents an encoding of an
                  old description, and not the de visu observations of the current encoder.</p>

                  classify the manuscript according to a known scheme and to provide a special or
                  supplied name that has become established in the research tradition.</p>
               <p>There are many characteristics involved in assigning a name to a manuscript. The
                  most important is the so-called generic or unified name, based on typological
                  characteristics, with values such as <hi rend="italic">Psalter</hi> or <hi
                     rend="italic">Miscellany</hi>. In some cases manuscripts may also already have
                  unique names, such as <hi rend="italic">Codex Zographensis</hi> or <hi
                     rend="italic">Kodov Triodion</hi>. These names should be provided
                  separately.</p>
               <p>The <gi>msName</gi> element contains only plain text. The <att>type</att>
                  attribute may be used to give further information whether the name is general
                  (i.e., unified or generic) or individual (nickname). The following example from
                  the description of <hi rend="italic">Codex Marianus</hi> demonstrates the use of
                  this element:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msName type="general" xml:lang="la">Tetraeuangelion</msName>
                  <msName type="general" xml:lang="bg">Четвероевангелие</msName>
                  <msName type="individual" current="yes" xml:lang="bg">Мариинско евангелие</msName>
                  <msName type="individual" subtype="current" xml:lang="la">Codex Marianus</msName>
                  <msName type="individual" subtype="old" xml:lang="en">Grigorovič
                     tetraeuangelion</msName>
                  <msName type="individual" subtype="old" xml:lang="en">Athonite
                     tetraeuangelion</msName>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>Here general information about the manuscript name in Latin and in Bulgarian is
                  annotated with the values <val>general</val> or <val>individual</val> for the
                     <att>type</att> attribute. The manuscript name currently accepted among
                  scholars is <hi rend="italic">Codex Marianus</hi> and the older names are <hi
                     rend="italic">Grigorovič tetraeuangelion</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Athonite
                     tetraeuangelion</hi>.</p>
               <p>When the manuscript has different nicknames for separate parts that are kept in
                  different repositories, this information goes into corresponding sections of
                  description. In case of the <hi rend="italic">Codex Marianus</hi>, there are two
                  leaves now kept in Vienna that have been known by two names that are no longer
                  generally used: <hi rend="italic">Mihanović folia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                     >Miklošič folia</hi>:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <head>A paragraph between the name of the manuscript and its location</head>
               <p>The use of this paragraph is restricted to cases when special annotation is needed
                  to summarize the locations of different parts of the same manuscript. The current
                  location in different countries, archives, or collections could require a special
                  description, possibly with links to sections on manuscript history, acquisition,
                  and to the various signatures or numbers in various catalogues. The following
                  extract from the description of <hi rend="italic">Manuilev Apostolos</hi> by
                  Margaret Dimitrova and Andrej Bojadžiev illustrates this approach:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <p>Six fragments belonging to what was once a larger codex have been identified by

               </egXML></p>
               <p>This short introduction to the cataloguing information in the description of the
                     <hi rend="italic">Manuilev Apostle</hi> is needed to understand the rest of the
                  description.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Location of the manuscript</head>
               <div>
                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>The next part of the electronic cataloguing information is devoted to the place
                     where the manuscript is kept. There are three levels for this information:
                     geographical pointers, institutional identification, and (optionally) data
                     regarding the collection in which the manuscript is kept. The latter often
                     appears as part of the shelfmark designation. The order of these elements is
                     important, proceeding from largest to smallest:</p>
                  <list type="numbered">
                     <item>country</item>
                     <item>geographical region</item>
                     <item>city or place name</item>
                     <item>repository</item>
                     <item>collection</item>
                     <item>shelfmark, inventory number or some other designation</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This set of elements is followed by optional identifying information based on
                        <term>secundo folio</term> and bibliographic records.</p>
                  <p>Following example from the description of MS Plovdiv 25 by Desislava Atanasova
                     illustrates the usage of the element:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Bulgaria</country>
                     <settlement>Plovdiv</settlement>
                     <repository>Plovdiv National Library</repository>
                     <idno type="shelfmark">25</idno></egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Country</head>
                  <p>The simplest content of the element <gi>country</gi> is the name of country,
                     e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Bulgaria</country>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>In some cases it may be useful to provide a country code as well as a country
                     name. This can be achieved by supplying a value to the <att>key</att>
                     attribute. It is recommended by the TEI that this value follow the country
                     names and codes defined by ISO 3166 (Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                     <gi>country</gi>). The encoder can choose among three representations defined
                     in the standard: alpha-2 code (two-letter, ISO 3166-1-alpha-2-code), alpha-3
                     code (three-letter, ISO 3166-1-alpha-3-code), and numeric code (ISO
                     3166-numeric). The three variants are illustrated below:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country key="bg">Bulgaria</country>
                     <country key="BGR">Bulgaria</country>
                     <country key="100">Bulgaria</country>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>For the full list see Common Data Hub: ISO 3166 Country Codes.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Settlement (city or town, etc.)</head>
                  <p>The next part of the cataloguing information is related to the place where the
                     manuscript is currently kept. Two different elements are provided for this
                     purpose. In most cases the manuscript is kept in libraries or archives in
                     cities, for which the element <gi>settlement</gi> is used:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <settlement>Sankt Peterburg</settlement>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The type of settlement may be specified more precisely by adding a standard
                     value for the <att>type</att> attribute, as in this example:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <settlement type="town">Kazanlăk</settlement>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Region</head>
                  <p>When the name of place is not well known or where there could be two or more
                     places with the same name, an additional element <gi>region</gi> may be added.
                     The <gi>region</gi> element describes an administrative unit smaller than a
                     country but larger than a city, town, or village (Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                        <gi>region</gi>), as in the following example, where Alino is a village in
                     the Sofia province (<hi rend="italic">oblast</hi>) of Bulgaria, but not within
                     the city limits of Sofia:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <region type="district">Sofia</region>
                     <settlement type="village">Alino</settlement>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Place and geographical names</head>
                  <p>When a codex is kept in a specific place not normally considered a region or
                     settlement, e.g., in a monastery, the alternative elements <gi>placeName</gi>
                     and <gi>geogName</gi> may be used. These elements are part of the TEI element
                     infrastructure and may contain plain text, sub-elements like <gi>region</gi>
                     (for some places that are smaller than countries, but bigger than cities) or
                        <gi>district</gi> (for names of non-administrative, geographical places).
                     With the help of <gi>geogFeat</gi> we can encode such geographical features as
                     valley, river, mount, etc. (Burnard and Bauman 2007: <gi>geogFeat</gi>). We can
                     then provide the name of the place using the general-purpose <gi>name</gi>
                     element.</p>
                  <p>The choice in this case should be made on the level of the whole project,
                     unifying the structure of the information in order to format, transform or
                     search the data. For example, a possible encoding for manuscripts kept at the
                     Zograph Monastery on Mount Athos could look like the following:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <geogName>
                        <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                        <name>Athos</name>
                     </geogName>
                     <placeName type="monastery">Zograph monastery</placeName>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The same information could be encoded in at least two other ways. The first is
                     using a general purpose element <gi>name</gi> with a <att>type</att> attribute,
                     e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <name type="monastery">Zograph monastery</name>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The other is to use a special referencing string as the value of the
                        <att>key</att> attribute, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <placeName key="ZM" type="monastery">Zograph Monastery</placeName>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>In the last example the <gi>placeName</gi> element has two special attributes.
                     As explained in the TEI Guidelines <att>key</att>
                     <q>provides an externally-defined means of identifying the entity (or entities)
                        being named, using a coded value of some kind</q>. (Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                        <ident>att.canonical/key</ident>) and <att>type</att> is intended to be used
                     as a general characteristic of the place name. A project that observes this
                     convention should provide a list of abbreviations, one of which would be
                        <abbr>ZM</abbr> (= <expan>Zograph Monastery</expan>). For the manuscripts
                     kept in the St. Catherine Monastery on Mount Sinai the same model is also
                     appropriate, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Egypt</country>
                     <geogName>
                        <geogFeat>Mount</geogFeat>
                        <name>Sinai</name>
                     </geogName>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Repository (library, archive, etc.)</head>
                  <p>The next piece of information in the electronic description,
                        <gi>repository</gi>, identifies a public or private library or archive. This
                     element should contain a common or official designation, as in this example
                     from the electronic description of MS IX.H.16 by Irina Kuzidova:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <country>Czech Republic</country>
                     <settlement>Prague</settlement>
                     <repository>National Museum</repository>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Name of the institution</head>
                  <p>Sometimes the repository in which a manuscript is located is part of another
                     institution, and in such cases the name of the institution comes before the
                     name of the archive, as in the following examples:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <institution>University of Sofia</institution>
                     <repository>Central University Library</repository>
                  </egXML>
                     or
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <institution>Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</institution>
                     <repository>Scientific Archives</repository>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Shelfmarks, inventory and catalogue designations</head>
                  <p>This information is provided as the content of the element <gi>idno</gi>. The
                        <gi>idno</gi> element has an <att>type</att> value that specifies whether
                     the identification is a shelfmark, inventory number, or catalogue number. This
                     attribute value is especially important in archives that combine several
                     collections that may be arranged and identified according to former owners or
                     thematic principles. In practice, shelfmarks are often formed from the initials
                     or special codes for separate collections. Typical examples could be:</p>
                  <p>1. shelfmark:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <idno type="shelfmark">Пог. 8</idno>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>2. Designation in the catalogue:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <idno type="catalogue">1</idno>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>3. Identifying information in an inventory catalogue:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <idno type="inventory">5/1946</idno>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>

                  <p>The best way to differentiate between current and former designations is to
                     embed <gi>idno</gi> elements for non-current identifiers inside
                        <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements. Consider the following examples:</p>
                  <p>1. Manuscript with shelfmark, inventory number, and catalogue number (from the
                     electronic description of MS 1415 of NLCM, Sofia by Dilyana Radoslavova):

                  <p>2. Manuscript with current and several former shelfmarks (from the electronic
                     description of MS 1/102 of Odessa State Libary by Anisava Miltenova):
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                           <idno type="shelfmark">1/211</idno>

                        <altIdentifier type="former">

                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>In this example the manuscript has one current and three former shelfmarks and
                     it is described in the catalogue as item number 20.</p>
                  <p>By setting the value of the <att>type</att> attribute in the
                        <gi>altIdentifier</gi> element the encoder can choose between the values
                        <q>current</q> and <q>former</q> and then supply appropriate values in its
                     sub-elements, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <altIdentifier type="current"> … <idno type="shelfmark">Ms 3045</idno> … </altIdentifier>

                  <head>Collections</head>
                  <p>Some repositories use a complex archiving system with special divisions among
                     separate collections and archives. Very often the sections bear the names of
                     previous owners or commissioners, which can be represented with the
                        <gi>collection</gi> element. The <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att>
                     attributes are available for cases where a more detailed characterization is
                     necessary.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>collection</gi> element may contain unstructured (plain) text, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <collection>П. Сырку</collection>
                     <idno>15</idno>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>In this fragment it is stated that the collection belongs to the materials of
                     P. Syrku and is catalogued under the number 15.</p>
                  <p>When thе <gi>collection</gi> element appears, it is immediately followed by the
                     shelfmark or inventory number as an identification inside the collection, as in
                     the following example (from the electronic description of a Vidin Miscellany by
                     Antoaneta Granberg):
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <msIdentifier> … <collection>M. Pogodin</collection>
                        <idno type="shelfmark">Pog. 1204</idno>
                        <altIdentifier type="current">
                           <idno type="catalogue">77</idno>
                        </altIdentifier> … </msIdentifier></egXML></p>
                  <p>In some cases the current collection of a repository may have absorbed an
                     entire earlier repository collection. This is often the case in Russian
                     collections like the Russian National Library in Sankt-Petersburg, the
                     Historical Museum, the Russian State Library, and the Russian State Archive of
                     Ancient Acts. In this case it is helpful to include this information, as well,
                     e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <msIdentifier>

                        <collection>ф. 304. III.</collection>
                        <idno type="shelfmark">3</idno>

                        </altIdentifier>
                        <altIdentifier type="former">
                           <collection>Tr.-Serg. Lavra</collection>
                           <idno type="shelfmark">3</idno>
                        </altIdentifier>
                     </msIdentifier>
                  </egXML></p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Various parts of the manuscript in one repository</head>
                  <p>In this case information about the country, city, geographical or place names,
                     and repository remain the same, and only information about the shelfmarks,
                     collections, or catalogue numbers differ. This approach is illustrated below

                  <head>One and the same manuscript in different repositories</head>
                  <p>When the manuscript has become separated, with fragments now stored in
                     different repositories, the encoder should use the element
                        <gi>altIdentifier</gi> to designate each part. There are two main cases:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item>If the manuscript is separated into one larger part and several smaller
                        pieces, the cataloguing part of the description could be included
                        immediately after <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and the other parts inside
                           <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements.</item>
                     <item>An alternative approach, which does not encode a distinction between main
                        and minor parts, is to designate all parts inside <gi>altIdentifier</gi>
                        elements. This approach could be used especially when there is no
                        unambiguous main part. The following information about the Slepcha Apostol
                        illustrates one way of representing cataloguing information about a
                        manuscript that has become fragmented across repositories:

                     </gi>elements</head>
                  <p>In an analytical catalogue where there may be combinations of former and
                     current collections and shelfmarks in a repository, it is often useful to
                     encode all these designations. The encoder can then further explain the history
                     of the manuscript in sections about its origin, provenance, and
                     acquisition.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>altIdentifier</gi> element may be used in the Repertorium approach as a
                     child of <gi>msIdentifier</gi> is to represent the current or old
                     identification of a codex or to distinguish among parts of one and the same
                     manuscript now dispersed within one or over more than one repository.</p>
                  <p>The element <gi>idno</gi>, on the other hand, is used for various kinds of
                     designations, such as shelfmarks and inventory or catalogue numbers. In this
                     approach, if we have a part of the manuscript in one repository with an old
                     shelfmark or collection identification that is still in use, it is necessary to
                     allow <gi>altIdentifier</gi> to appear elsewhere, in the description of other
                     parts, as in:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <altIdentifier type="partial" xml:id="RSL_Grig14">
                        <country>Russia</country>
                        <settlement>Moscow</settlement>
                        <repository>Russian State Library</repository>
                        <idno type="shelfmark">Grig. 14</idno>
                        <collection>V. Grigorovic</collection>
                        <altIdentifier type="former">
                           <idno type="shelfmark">M. 1696</idno>
                        </altIdentifier>
                     </altIdentifier>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>In this example both Grig. 14 and M. 1696 are used as identifiers even though
                     the latter points to a previous owner. In this case the shelfmark signifies the
                     intermediate change of owner. Further details should be given in the section
                     about the history of the codex.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Secundo folio</head>
                  <p>This element is very rare in the Slavic medieval and early modern tradition,
                     but for western medieval manuscripts it has been (mainly between the thirteenth
                     and sixteenth centuries) a common component of manuscript description. The term
                     refers to transcribing the first word or words from the second leaf of a codex.
                     The element <gi>secFol</gi> (Lat. <gloss>secundo folio</gloss>, or Eng.
                        <gloss>second folio</gloss>) is used for this purpose (Burnard and Bauman
                     2007: <gi>secFol</gi>). The following example, from a description of MS Crispin
                     16, Dutschke et al. 1987: 35–36, illustrates this usage:

                        <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements as part of the content of a <gi>note</gi>
                     element. Typical information includes internal or external bibliographic or

               <head>General remarks</head>
               <p>The markup definition of the physical structure should be entered in the element
                     <gi>physDesc</gi> (Burnard and Bauman 2007), which unites information about the
                  physical condition of the manuscript with observations about the material, layout,
                  binding, and decoration. The encoder can choose between two options:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item>To provide a very short sketch of different features of the manuscript in
                     paragraphs, or</item>
                  <item>To use special elements in a structured description of material, layout,
                     binding, decoration, etc.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the former approach the encoder should use only paragraphs, as in this example
                  from the electronic description of MS CIAI 369 by Margaret Dimitrova (simplified):
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <physDesc>
                     <p>4+516 ff. (Stojanov wrongly gives 273ff.). Paper with watermark of three
                        cylinders with letters FA. 230 x 180 mm. In 1 column, 30 lines per page</p>
                     <p>Greek cursive of the 19th century.</p>

                        both covers.</p>
                     <p>The codex is in good condition. The folios containing the Table of contents
                        are now unfolded. Originally they formed the last quire of the
                        manuscript.</p>
                  </physDesc>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>The element <gi>physDesc</gi> has no special attributes. Its only use is to
                  contain elements that encode the physical characteristics of the manuscript.</p>
               <p>The second approach also permits the use of the element <gi>p</gi>, in this case
                  for an introduction to the physical description.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Description of material and layout</head>
               <p>Information about manuscript materials and their characteristics and about the
                  layout of the leaves is encoded within <gi>objectDesc</gi>. This element has one
                  special attribute, <att>form</att>, with proposed values (cf. Burnard and Bauman
                  2007) <val>codex</val>, <val>roll</val>, <val>fragment</val>, <val>leaf</val>,
                     <val>partial leaf</val>, or some typologically relevant value, e.g.:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <objectDesc form="codex"> … </objectDesc></egXML>

               </egXML>
               </p>
               <p>This information could be entered as an unstructured sequence of paragraphs or as
                  part of the content of the specialized elements <gi>supportDesc</gi> and
                     <gi>layoutDesc</gi> .</p>

               <head>Description of physical support</head>
               <p>The information in <gi>supportDesc</gi> may be entered in two ways: <list
                     rend="numbered">
                     <item>as an unstructured (paragraph) view, or</item>
                     <item>using specialized elements.</item>
                  </list> Here we illustrate an overview of the use of structured data for various
                  aspects of cataloguing the support. </p>
               <p><gi>supportDesc</gi> has one important attribute, <att>material</att>. Valuea of
                  this attribute, as suggested by TEI Guidelines (Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                     <gi>supportDesc</gi>), are most commonly <q>parchment</q>, <q>paper</q>, or
                     <q>mixed</q>, as in this example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <supportDesc material="paper"> … </supportDesc>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>The meaning of the value of this attribute is to give a general type of the
                  material of the manuscript, and it is not associated with the possible
                  construction of manuscript’s binding or the box in which the manuscript is kept.
                  Especially in cases when the value is <q>mixed</q>, a further explanation should
                  be provided.</p>
               <p>The order of information in this element is significant, and follows traditional
                  paper-based descriptions. There is no required minimal content, and the range of
                  information depends on the opportunities the researcher may have had to work with
                  the manuscript de visu. A brief explanation of the proposed elements is as
                  follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item><gi>support</gi>: describes in more detail the material of the leaves or
                     roll</item>
                  <item><gi>extent</gi>: describes the size of manuscript in terms like number of
                     folia or pages, or the length of the roll</item>
                  <item><gi>foliation</gi> and/or <gi>pagination</gi>: information about whether the
                     manuscript is foliated (paginated), with further explanation</item>
                  <item><gi>collation</gi>: description of the folia collation, ruling, pricking,
                     and other features related to the quire structure</item>
                  <item><gi>condition</gi>: an overview of possible damage, absence or addition of
                     folia, blank leaves, etc.</item>
               </list>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Detailed description of material</head>
               <p>This information could be entered as plain text in the form of paragraphs
                     (<gi>p</gi>) in the element <gi>support</gi> or as one or more instances of the
                  element <gi>material</gi>. It contains a brief statement that can serve as an
                  overview of a more in-depth description that can follow. Here is an example of the
                  first type, from the electronic description of MS Rila 3/6 by Dilyana Radoslavova,
                  simplified:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <support>
                     <p>Paper with <watermark>Harbalet in Ring</watermark>: similar to
                           <bibl>Harlfinger Nr. 2/a</bibl> from the years 1471–72</p>
                  </support>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>In the case of an analytical description we may choose to use a paragraph as just
                  an introduction to a more elaborate description of the material, or we may use
                  only one or more <gi>material</gi> elements, with the decision often depending on
                  the completeness of available information. For example, if we are describing a
                  manuscript that we have not been able to examine de visu, or are creating an
                  electronic edition on the basis of an old catalogue, we may lack information about
                  the paper or quality of parchment. In such cases we may ignore the
                     <gi>support</gi> section of the description and provide the information we do
                  have only as the value of the attribute <att>material</att> on the element
                     <gi>supportDesc</gi>, as in the example above.</p>
               <p>In contrast with this, when we use one or more <gi>material</gi> elements not as
                  part of <gi>p</gi>, that means that we have enough information to provide a
                  detailed parchment or paper description of the codex. Consider the following
                  template:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <supportDesc material="mixed">
                     <support>
                        <material key="parchment">Here is the information about parchment.</material>
                        <material key="paper">Here is the information about paper.</material>
                     </support> … </supportDesc>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>Here the <att>key</att> attribute is used to distinguish the different materials
                  in the manuscript. The element <gi>material</gi> can include an attribute
                     <att>material</att>, with values that might include (but are not limited to):
                     <list rend="simple">
                     <item><val>original</val>: original parchment used for the main body of the

               <p>The description of parchment is restricted to the technological process and its
                  outer appearance. However, the encoder might wish to add a statement regarding the
                  origin, quality, color and thickness of the parchment, as in the following
                  examples (from <ptr target="https://www.mossercatalogue.net/record.php?recID=Hg"
                  />):

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>The description of paper in recent catalogues is much more complicated than the
                     description of parchment. On the one hand, there are various levels of detailed
                     information in the catalogues, and, on the other, there are much more
                     specialized research initiatives in the field of paper and watermark studies.
                     Therefore, the description of the paper in a manuscript could consist of an
                     overview and comments followed by a description of watermarks and of other
                     aspects of the paper production. A simple paper description is illustrated by
                     the following excerpt from the electronic description of Add. Ms 37233 by
                     Dilyana Radoslavova (simplified):
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <material usage="original">

                     </egXML>
                  </p>
                  <p>The description of obviously different kind of paper, possibly from various
                     manufactures and of varying quality and age, could be accomplished by repeating
                     the element <gi>material</gi> and its attributes exactly in the same manner as
                     it is implemented for the description of parchment.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Watermarks</head>
                  <p>The central and most important information in the description of the paper is
                     the watermark, and information on its characteristics is part of the element
                        <gi>watermark</gi>. The content of this element includes phrase-level
                     elements, as well as specialized elements like <gi>countermark</gi> and
                        <gi>motif</gi>.</p>
                  <p>There are several special attributes for the content of this element.
                        <att>tracing</att> is used to describe very briefly (with one word) the
                     method of watermark tracing. The most usual method is still drawing by hand,
                     but other possibilities include rubbing by hand, use of special Dylux print
                     paper, beta- or x-radiography, scanning, etc. The <att>place</att> attribute
                     from the <ident>class att.placement</ident> class can specify more precisely
                     the location of the watermark on the page. This feature could be described in
                     relation to chain and laid (also called wire) lines. The possible content might
                     read something like <q>between widely spaced chain lines</q>, <q>on a chain
                        line</q>, <q>on a supplemental chain line</q>, <q>across 2 chain lines</q>,
                        <q>across 3 chain lines</q>, or could be expressed in some other terms,
                     e.g., in millimeters between various locations on the leaf.</p>
                  <div>
                     <head>Motif</head>
                     <p>The element <gi>motif</gi> is the most important part of the watermark
                        description because it is intended to represent information from a special
                        terminological apparatus of watermark design. There are several ways to
                        include motif information:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>In the absence of reference books and watermark albums, simply as
                           plain text</item>
                        <item>If a more complicated motif is present and the encoder would like to
                           provide full compatibility with professional watermark databases, with
                           the attribute <att>type</att>, as described below</item>
                        <item>By <q>secondary</q> is meant designs above or below the basic motif.
                           Frequently used motifs above the basic one include bird, cross, flower,
                           monograms, monograms with a combination with figures (e.g., monogram BA
                           and cross), ramrod, different star shapes, star and monogram, trefoil,
                           etc. Frequently used motifs below the basic one include grapes,
                           monograms, etc.</item>
                        <item>By <q>supplemental</q> is meant supplemental characteristics of the
                           basic motif, e.g., in circle, in oval, in shield, etc.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>In this approach a typical description of the motif <q>anchor in circle with
                           5-point star above</q> could be encoded hierarchically, as follows:

                  <item>
                     <term>Wire lines</term>: Information about wire (also known as laid) lines
                     could contain: <list rend="simple">

                  <item><term>Chain or laid lines</term>: The most important feature of chain lines
                     is the spacing between them, which could be described by entering the element
                        <gi>dim</gi> and its sub element <gi>height</gi>. The following are
                     recommendations from the Watermark Initiative: <q>If the watermark is on the
                        chain line the spaces on either side of it should be given in parentheses:
                        28,25,(15,14),28,25. If the watermark is positioned between or across two
                        chain lines, the space between them should be given in parentheses:

                     thickness value. This value could be relative, e.g.: very thin, thin, medium
                     thin, medium, medium thick, thick, very thick; or, alternatively, it could be
                     measured in another way.</item>

                     include: smooth, matte, fuzzy, patina, glazed, bumpy, etc. It is also possible
                     to record whether dark fibers or wire lines are visible on the surface of the
                     paper.</item>
                  <item><term>Stiffness</term>: Information about the stiffness of paper is rare in
                     manuscript descriptions, but possible values could include: stiff, crisp,
                     supple, limp, etc.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p><term>Date of the paper</term>: The dating of paper is usually part of the
                        watermark description, which is the most familiar location for that
                        information because the watermark image is the most characteristic part of
                        the paper description. In addition to providing the date or date range, the
                        encoder could further specify the justification for the dating. Possible
                        values could include: <list rend="numbered">

                     <p>The date range could be entered with the asterisk (*) as a wildcard, so
                        that, for example, the expression <q>15**</q> would mean the range from 1500
                        to 1599, <q>156*</q>, from 1560 to 1569, and <q>156*–157*</q> - each year

               <head>Number of leaves or folia</head>
               <p>The number of folia in the manuscript is entered in the element <gi>extent</gi>,
                  which may be accompanied by the element <gi>measure</gi> with the attribute
                     <att>unit</att> to specify whether the count refers to leaves or to pages.
                  Consider the following example from the description of manuscript 369 from the
                  Church Historical and Archival Institute in Sofia:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <extent>
                     <measure unit="folia">4+516
                        <note>Stojanov wrongly gives 73ff.</note>
                     </measure>
                  </extent>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>It is possible to include links to information in the same file or outside it,
                  e.g.:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <extent>2 <ref target="EOENB146">(Vienna)</ref>+171

                  </extent>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>This shows the location of the folia in both repositories. The <hi rend="italic"
                     >Codex Marianus</hi> consists of 2 ff. kept in Vienna and 171 in Moscow. The
                  element <gi>ref</gi> adds a link to the corresponding part of the description
                     (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>or <gi>altIdentifier</gi>).</p>
               <p>An even more complicated example can be illustrated by the description of the <hi

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>All sorts of dimensions could be entered into the element <gi>dimensions</gi>,
                     and the attribute <att>type</att> gives a hint to the encoder of possible uses
                     for the element. The attribute <att>unit</att> provides three possible values
                     and <att>scope</att> emphasizes the range of these dimensions.</p>
                  <p>The element <gi>dimensions</gi> could be can be used in many places where
                     measurement is requirement, and it has three special attributes for that
                     purpose. The attribute <att>type</att> provides a common typology of the
                     dimensions of a given manuscript source. Possible values comprise all important
                     parts of the physical description and layout. Commonly used dimensions are
                     those of leaves, dimensions of the written area, and the height of the
                     characters or lines. The author of the description may, however, find it useful
                     to mention also the dimensions of the ruled or pricked region of the page and
                     quire, as well as to provide measurements for the borders. It is even possible
                     to distinguish the dimension of a single letter in comparison to the whole
                     line.</p>
                  <p>The most useful units of measurement in manuscript description are
                        <term>mm</term> and <term>cm</term>, but sometimes, especially in the
                     description of initials, a measurement in lines per page or characters per line
                     (chars) could be more useful.</p>
                  <p>To supply information on the possible range of dimensions, the compiler of the
                     catalogue information may find it convenient to use the attribute
                        <att>scope</att> with the exact value of a particular part of the
                     manuscript.</p>

                  <head>Example</head>
                  <p>A possible example could be:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <dimensions unit="mm" type="folia">

                  <p>Any other dimensions can be supplied through the general-purpose element
                        <gi>dim</gi>. For example, in measuring binding panels:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <dimensions type="panels" unit="mm">

                  electronic description of MS Pogodin 1204 by Antoaneta Granberg:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                     <item>to begin with a general overview using the element <gi>p</gi> but also to
                        describe such characteristics as signatures, catchwords, pricking, ruling or

                     <item>when some of the quires deviate from the general rules, to describe them

                  </list></p>
               <p>A simple description could include the element <gi>p</gi> with a formula, e.g.:

                  <p>An important part of the description of quires is how they are marked at their
                     beginning and/or end. The description should include a phrase defining the form
                     and place at the beginning and end of the quire, as well as any changes, e.g.:

                  <p>The element <gi>quire</gi> brings together all possible features for the
                     characterization of the quire, including number, composition, how and where
                     quires are marked, and with the assistance of what tool. The element
                        <gi>formula</gi> provides information about how the quire is composed, of
                     how many folia, etc. The content of this element is a formula. Consider the
                     following example:

                  <p>This means that first quire of the manuscript was formed of 8 ff., all of
                     which, with the exception of the f. 7, are now missing. Quires II to XXI have 8
                     ff. each. From quire XXII one folio (7) is missing. The last, quire XXIII,
                     consisted originally of 6 ff. but only 2 of them (5 and 6) are preserved
                     intact.</p>

                  <p>The arrangement of the parchment folia as part of the quire structure is
                     entered here. Only de visu observations can identify the sequence and order of
                     parchment folia. There are two common abbreviations: HS for the hair (dark)
                     side and FS ∏for the flesh (light) side of the parchment. Thus, the content of
                     this element could be a sequence of HS and FS abbreviations, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <gregoryRule>HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS-FS|HS = HS|FS-FS|HS-HS|FS- FS|HS</gregoryRule>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>Here the sign <code>|</code> separates pages, <code>–</code> separates folia,
                     and <code>=</code> signifies the middle of the quire. In cases where there is
                     no rule, or there are deviations from it, this should be stated explicitly. If
                     the deviations are caused by the loss of leaves, it is possible to insert a
                     link pointing to the place where this loss is explained, e.g., in the content
                     of the element <gi>condition</gi>.</p>

                  <head>Ruling patterns and types</head>
                  <p>Two kinds of information regarding medieval manuscripts could be entered in the
                     element <gi>ruling</gi>. The first is related to the ruling type defined by
                     researchers such as Leroy (1976) or Gilissen (1977), who attempted to propose
                     formal, structured typologies of ruling types. In the other, information is
                     related to the place of ruling in the quire, or the so called
                        <term>scheme</term>. The former could be expressed as a formula of ruled
                     lines for writing, and the latter could be visualized as simple graphic showing
                     the places in the quire where the ruling is accomplished, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> 
                     <ruling>&gt;&gt; | &gt; | |&lt; |&lt;&lt; = &gt;&gt;| &gt;| |&lt; | &lt;&lt;</ruling>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>This scheme means that in this quire the ruling is made for each of the two
                     folia: once for the outer double leaf and once for the inner one (double sign:
                        <code>&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;</code>). The symbols
                        <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> mean that on the leaf there is just a
                     trace of the ruling made on the previous leaf. The attribute <att>type</att>
                     should provide information about the classification scheme employed (e.g.,
                     Gillisen or Leroy).</p>

                  <head>Prickings</head>
                  <p>Observations about prickings are relatively rare in the literature, even
                     though, as explained by Jones (1946a, 1946b), they could bear information about
                     scriptorial techniques. Thus, it is necessary to provide an element for such
                     types of information. Here is an example from DUL MS Cosin V.II.17 Anseis de
                     Carthage, Ogier le Danois (in French) s. xiii2 (<ptr
                        target="http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/theme/medmss/apvii17/"/>) encoded
                     in Repertorium model):

                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The following example is from the web-based electronic description of St.

                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <pricking> Most prick marks have been trimmed off. On p 112, 6 prick marks are

                        remain on the outer margin. There is no pricking on the inner
                        margins.</pricking>

               <head>The manuscript condition</head>
               <p>Information about the condition of the manuscript is entered in the element
                     <gi>condition</gi>. It is used mainly to describe damage to folia, quires, the
                  binding, or the whole manuscript. Traces of restoration processes could be encoded
                  in this element as well. Here is an example from the electronic description of
                  British Library Add MSS 23999 by Dilyana Radoslavova:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <condition>The manuscript is in good condition except for the last gathering, in

                     repaired and the text restored in a style very close to the
                     original.</condition>

            <div>
               <head>Description of the page layout</head>
               <p>This description is entered as part of the element <gi>layoutDesc</gi> (Burnard
                  and Bauman 2007). As in many other places in the model, you can choose between
                  unstructured description (with element <gi>p</gi>) or structured data in the
                  element <gi>layout</gi>, probably preceded by an introduction (element
                     <gi>summary</gi>).</p>
               <p>The element <gi>layout</gi> has three special attributes: <att>columns</att>,
                     <att>writtenLines</att> and <att>ruledLines</att>. If there are no further
                  explanations by the encoder, all the information can be supplied through these
                  attribute values:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <layoutDesc>
                     <layout columns="1" writtenLines="18" ruledLines="20"/>
                  </layoutDesc>

            <div>
               <head>Ink</head>
               <p>Information about the ink is presented usually as a simple phrase like “brown dark
                  ink for the basic text and red ink for the headings and small initials”. However,
                  such descriptions could then be further developed in order to supply information
                  on ink composition, or its brightness or its loss of colour. A simple description
                  could be:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <ink>Brown ink for the text and dark red for the initials</ink>
               </egXML>

            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Decoration</head>
               <p>The element <gi>decoDesc</gi> is used to provide information about manuscript
                  illumination. There are two basic ways of using this element and its children. The
                  first is to provide general prose descriptions of the styles and art objects in
                  the codex with the help of the element <gi>p</gi> elements. The second is to
                  construct a thorough description of each kind of manuscript decoration in the
                  element <gi>decoNote</gi>, possibly preceded by some kind of introduction (in the
                  element <gi>summary</gi>). Under the second approach, each <gi>decoNote</gi> is
                  supplied with the attribute <att>type</att> and an appropriate value, e.g.,
                     <val>miniatures</val>, <val>headpieces</val>, <val>tail-pieces</val>,
                     <val>initials</val>, <val>borders</val>, <val>line-fillers</val>,

                     Not original. Done probably in 16th century." In most cases this information is
                     entered in brief descriptions using the sub-element <gi>p</gi> of the element
                        <gi>bindingDesc</gi> (Burnard and Bauman 2007). The describer can supplement
                     this with further notes about the binding decoration (<gi>decoDesc</gi>) and
                     its recent condition (<gi>condition</gi>).</p>
                  <p>If the encoder prefers to use a structured description, a short statement
                     should be entered in the element <gi>binding</gi> as value of the attribute
                        <att>contemporary</att>, such as <val>true</val>, <val>false</val>,
                        <val>unknown</val>.</p>
                  <p>The encoder can include a short statement before continuing the description of
                     the binding, or he or she can provide only this information. In the latter case
                     he or she could give information about all of the main parts of the
                     book-binding structure and decoration. For example:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <bindingDesc>
                        <binding contemporary="true"><p>Brocade on wooden boards, 
                           <dimensions unit="mm" type="plate">
                              <width>145</width><height>205</height>
                           </dimensions>. Two clasps. The paste-downs and first and last flyleaves 
                           are backed with mauve cloth. Illumination and marginalia have suffered a 
                           little from excessive trimming. The edges of the pages are gauffred and 
                           gilded.Two metal bosses on the lower side of each cover.</p>
                           <condition>Well preserved.</condition>
                        </binding>
                     </bindingDesc> (from the description of British library Ms Egerton 3045 by
                     Dilyana Radoslavova) </egXML></p>
                  <p>All other aspects of the binding description, not covered by elements like
                        <gi>decoDesc</gi> or <gi>condition</gi>, could be entered in the element
                        <gi>bindingNote</gi> with different values of the attributes <att>type</att>
                     or <att>subtype</att>. For example, all aspects of the description of the cover
                     should be entered in the content of the element <tag>bindingNote
                        type="cover"</tag>. The material of the cover should be then described as
                     part of the sub-element <gi>material</gi>. The same is true also for other
                     parts of bookbinding, such as edges (e.g., technology, beveling of edges),
                     fly-leaves, etc. The observations in <gi>fastening</gi> could include how the
                     fastening is done, e.g., by peg and strap, by hook and clasp; the length or
                     width of the elements could be measured; their place(s) could be described,
                     etc. In <gi>furnishing</gi> the encoder should describe all the bosses, corner
                     pieces, etc. that can be observed on the binding.</p>
                  <p>A description of the sewing could include the types of attachments to the
                     quires and leaves or to the main boards. A text block can be sewn through the
                     side of the leaves, e.g., through as over sewing or side sewing, etc. In
                     addition, the text block can also be sewn through the fold of the sections by
                     hand. Three different patterns are observed: sewing structure, sewing stitches,
                     and sewing pattern:</p>
                  <p><term>Sewing structures</term>: supported = parts other than thread involved in
                     the connection of the sections. Materials for support usually are: cord,
                     parchment, skin, linen tape, etc. unsupported = only sewing thread connecting
                     the sections to each other. An unsupported structure is commonly found in
                     Greek, Islamic, and Oriental books.</p>
                  <p><term>Sewing stitches</term>, which is the motion of a thread from a sewing
                     station (hole) exit to a sewing station entry. The classification could be as
                     follows:</p>
                  <list rend="simple">
                     <item>Slip: thread passes under itself</item>
                     <item>Link: thread passes under another thread</item>
                     <item>Loop: circle around a support</item>
                     <item>Lap: passes over a support</item>
                     <item>Forward: continues in the direction of progression</item>
                     <item>Reverse: continues to the previous direction of progression</item>
                     <item>Drop: moves downward</item>
                     <item>Climb: moves upward</item>
                     <item>Incline: moves diagonally</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Sewing patterns. The main patterns are:</p>
                  <list rend="simple">
                     <item>Fold patterns: sequence of thread visible inside the fold of the section.
                        These are of two types: Continuous pattern: thread passing in and out each
                        sewing station to form a pattern; and Periodic pattern: thread skipping
                        sewing holes and leaves intervals between some of the stations.</item>
                     <item>Spine patterns: the pattern is formed by the stitches across the
                        uncovered spine of the book. Some spine patterns are: (1) Chain (formed by
                        link stitches), (2) Bridge (by span), (3) Ribs (by loop), (4) Herringbone
                        (by loop and link), (5) Steps (by lap), etc.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Interesting questions pertaining to the description of spines include:</p>
                  <list rend="simple">
                     <item>whether the form of the spine is rounded or flat (as an attribute
                           <att>type</att>);</item>
                     <item>whether there are raised or smooth bands;</item>

                     <item>whether there are headbands, whether they are double or triple, etc.; how
                        they are connected to the board; what their colours are; what material
                        they're made from.</item>

               <div>
                  <head>Date of binding and place where it is made</head>
                  <p>In most of the cases the binding of medieval manuscripts is latter then the
                     codex itself. Therefore the date and place of producing the binding should be
                     provided separately from the conclusions on date and place of origin of the
                     described book.
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <date certainty="likely">15 century</date>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>Sometimes the exact date is known from a note by the copyist or book-binder. In
                     these cases a reference to the description and its edition should be made,
                     e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <date certainty="yes">1667<ref target="note1">cf. bookbinder’s
                        note</ref></date> (from Tachiaos 1981: 69–70, No 25) </egXML></p>
                  <p>In this case the <gi>date</gi> element bears the attribute <att>certainty</att>
                     with the value <val>yes</val> and this information is further referenced with
                     the <att>target</att> attribute value <val>notel</val>. As in all other cases
                     with the elements <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi>, such an identifier must be
                     present. Another possible solution is to use in this case the element
                        <gi>ptr</gi> instead of <gi>ref</gi>. The element <gi>ptr</gi> is an empty
                     element and all its information is encoded with attributes. This means that we
                     would have to omit, e.g., a bookbinder’s note, yielding something like:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <date certainty="yes">1667<ptr target="note1"/></date>

               <head>Description of seals</head>
               <p>The description of seals attached to the manuscript follow the same model as
                  mentioned in the description of binding. The catalogue’s compiler could make a
                  short statement in form of paragraph or paragraphs (<gi>p</gi> or provide a
                  structured description in the form of decoration description (<gi>decoNote</gi>),
                  the condition of the seal(s) (<gi>condition</gi>) and the seal itself
                     (<gi>seal</gi>). The element <gi>seal</gi> has the same special attribute
                     <att>contemporary</att> with the same choice of values as <gi>binding</gi>.</p>

                  <p>There are several types of additional notes, some original to the manuscript,
                     that could be described in different ways. The first one, the colophon,
                     containing the name of the scribe, date and possibly place should be described
                     as part of the <gi>msItemStruct</gi> as stated below. Other notes go elsewhere.
                     Some examples follow.</p>

                     element</head>
                  <p>This is the most obvious place for the description of additions. The element
                        <gi>additions</gi> is the last part of the structure of <gi>physDesc</gi>
                     element. If there is just one addition, then the description and edition should
                     be ordered in the following order: <gi>locus</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
                     <gi>date</gi>. The description could consist of one or more paragraphs
                        (<gi>p</gi>) or it could be encoded as a <gi>list</gi> containing two or
                     more <gi>item</gi> elements. If there is just one note, the structure could be
                     as follows:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <p>In cases with more than one note, it might be most convenient to represent them

            <div>
               <head>General remarks</head>
               <p>In the Repertorium Initiative approach all data about the palaeographic and
                  linguistic aspects of the manuscripts are gathered together under the element
                     <gi>scribeDesc</gi>. This element represents an information level between the
                  pure physical description of the manuscript and a description of its content. As
                  elsewhere in this electronic model, both unstructured and structured approaches
                  are available. The unstructured description means entering the information only as
                  part of paragraph (<gi>p</gi>) elements. The structured approach involves encoding
                  information about each scribe (element <gi>scribe</gi>), possibly preceded by an
                  overview (element <gi>summary</gi>). When the second approach is adopted, the
                  first elements to be entered are the name and the place in the manuscript where
                  the scribe has written it. If the name of the scribe is not available or unknown,
                  the encoder can record that as:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <scribeDesc>

               </egXML></p>
               <p>This information is followed by a description of palaeographic and linguistic
                  features, along with additional notes as needed.</p>

               <head>Palaeographical features</head>
               <p>The analysis of the palaeographical features of the manuscript should be
                  accomplished in the element <gi>palaeoCharact</gi>. The content of this element is
                  a combination of paragraph (<gi>p</gi>) elements with other elements specific for
                  the description of palaeography. This means that the encoder may enter either
                  unstructured or structured information, and under the latter approach such
                  features as musical notation or encrypted writing can be described with
                  specialized tags. The <gi>palaeoCharact</gi> element has one important attribute –
                     <att>script</att>. The value of this attribute should be short code that is
                  compatible with international standards of script designations (ISO 15924), e.g.,
                     <val>Grek</val> for Greek, <val>Cyrl</val> for Modern Cyrillic, <val>Cyrs</val>
                  for Old Cyrillic, <val>Latn</val> for Latin or <val>Glag</val> for Glagolitic
                  (http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html):

               <p>A brief introduction to the palaeographical characteristics of the scribe can be

                        <att>type</att>, which could further systematize the notation:

                  <head>General remarks</head>
                  <p>In the framework of Repertorium Initiative there is a clear distinction between
                     the language of the text and the language of the scribe. The language of the
                     text is understood in relation to the text history, cf. the section pertaining
                     to manuscript content. The language of the scribe or scribes may or may not be
                     related with the text history and text analysis. Therefore, a special section
                     in the manuscript description is need to allow it to be treated separately.</p>
                  <p>The language of the scribe can be described as unstructured paragraph
                        (<gi>p</gi>)elements or as a sequence of the elements <gi>orthography</gi>,
                        <gi>grammar</gi> and <gi>lexis</gi>, optionally introduced by general
                     observations in the element <gi>summary</gi>.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Orthography</head>
                  <p>Encoders of Slavonic manuscripts have two possible ways to describe
                     orthographic features. The first is to provide only a brief characteristic in
                     the element <gi>p</gi>, e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <orthography>
                        <p>The scribe writes with two jers and with nonetymological appearance of
                           juses. After the letters ш, ж, in the word-initial position (after j),
                           and after the vowel letters front nasal is turned into the back one.
                           After ч this change is not observed. A relatively small number of
                           ligatures and supralinear signs. A few examples of accent marks
                        …</p></orthography>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The other way to describe the orthography of the scribe is with a structured
                     description, where each piece of the description is entered as a separate
                     element.</p>
                  <div>
                     <head>The element <gi>orthNote</gi></head>
                     <p>The rules for the usage of different letters and signs are described as
                        content of the element <gi>orthNote</gi>. It contains the attributes
                           <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att>, which are used to typologize the
                        orthography of the scribe in appropriate ways, especially with respect to
                        three groups of letters: jers, juses and letters for jotated vowels.</p>
                     <div>
                        <head>The orthography of the jers</head>
                        <p>Information regarding this feature is entered in the element
                              <gi>orthNote</gi> with value of attribute <code>type="jer"</code>. The
                           encoder can describe the positions of jers and their relationship to the
                           etymological condition, along with examples of their usage. This element
                           has one required attribute: <att>subtype</att>. Possible values are:</p>
                        <list rend="simple">
                           <item>front: only front jer is used</item>
                           <item>back: only back jer is used</item>
                           <item>etymReg: etymologically regular use of jers</item>
                           <item>nonEtymReg: not etymological but regular use of jers</item>
                           <item>irregular: the use of jers cannot be formalized in general
                              rules.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>For example, manuscripts written with Tarnovo orthographic norms use both
                           jers regularly, but in a non-etymological way. The same is true for the
                           Zograph Folia from the tenth century, as in the following example:
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                           <orthography>
                              <orthNote type="jer" subtype="nonEtymReg">Both jers are used but jery
                                 is written only with front jer. There is a tendency to substitute
                                 back with front jer before a syllable with front vowel.</orthNote>
                           </orthography>
                        </egXML></p>

                     <div>
                        <head>The orthography of the juses</head>
                        <p>The description of the orthography of the juses is very similar to that
                           of jers, addressing the positions where juses are or are not used,
                           etymologically correct or incorrect usage, etc. The element
                              <gi>orthNote</gi> is used here, too, but with value <val>jus</val> of
                           the attribute <att>type</att>. Here, the possible values of
                              <att>subtype</att> attribute are:</p>

                           <item>etymReg: etymologically regular use of juses (e.g., as in Old

                              juses, but with traces, e.g., manuscripts written generally with
                              non-jus orthography but with traces of the Middle Bulgarian
                              alternation of juses</item>

                        <p>In many cases the distribution of jers and juses may provide enough data
                           to determine the main features of a specific medieval Slavic orthographic
                           system. To be more precise, however, the description of letters for
                           jotated vowels may also be important. This information is also part of
                           the element <gi>orthNote</gi> with the value <val>jotVowel</val> of the
                           attribute <att>type</att>. For example:
                           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                           <orthography>

                           exception of musical notation and cryptographic systems follow the model
                           as described here for jotated vowels. The same model could be used for
                           the description of non-Slavic orthographic features, as well.</p>

                  <p>The description of grammatical characteristics could be divided into separate
                     units, but in this case, unlike with orthography, there may not be a standard
                     list of descriptive criteria, and the researcher has to introduce the structure
                     using the available means. Consider the following example from the electronic
                     description of <hi rend="italic">Codex Marianus</hi> by Margaret Dimitrova,
                     Andrej Bojadžiev and Elisaveta Moussakova:

                  <head>Description of lexical features</head>
                  <p>Lexical features can be described similarly to grammatical ones. Whether this
                     takes the form of a list with items or of just one unit depends on the
                     encoder’s vision and the length of the material, as in the following example
                     from the electronic description of <title level="m">Codex Marianus</title> by
                     Margaret Dimitrova, Andrej Bojadžiev, and Elisaveta Moussakova:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <lexis>The manuscript uses lexis that is believed to be typical of the earliest
                        Gospel translation from Greek, cf. the use of the archaic lexemes 
                        <foreign xml:lang="cu">баль, жаль, миса, шюи, братръ, небесьскъ, неприѣзнь, 
                           пропѧти, иночѧдъ, врътъ, искрьнъ, грѣсти</foreign> could prove this hypothesis. 
                        Also, in word-formation the manuscript prefers the old suffix 
                        <m xml:lang="cu" type="suffix">ице ѫ</m> and not <m xml:lang="cu" type="suffix">ждь</m>. 
                        Still, the following forms are considered to be relatively later: 
                        <foreign xml:lang="cu">благодать, написание, дрѧхлъ</foreign>.</lexis>

            <head>The manuscript contents</head>
            <p>The description of the manuscript contents in the Repertorium electronic description
               model is distributed over two main parts, one pertaining to the manuscript as a
               single body of texts and the other to each text individually.</p>
            <div>
               <head>The content of the whole manuscript</head>
               <p>The content of the whole manuscript is described in the element
                     <gi>msContents</gi>. Nothing in this element is mandatory, but the element
                  itself is required, and the encoder might start by defining the range of texts in
                  terms of the research tradition. There are three special attributes for this
                  element. The first, <att>type</att>, can record whether the manuscript collection
                  of texts is original (<att>original</att>) or represents either an earlier
                  compilation or a translation. The second, <att>style</att>, can situate the
                  manuscript within a broad typology, viz., choosing between the values
                     <val>narrative</val> and <val>non-narrative</val>. The third, <att>class</att>,
                  can be used to provide a convenient typology for all the texts in the manuscript.
                  The usage of these three attributes with their values can be illustrated with this
                  example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msContents class="vitas" type="translation" style="narrative"> … </msContents>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>Here the basic information about all the texts in the manuscript is given. In this
                  case, the main classification of the texts falls under the category of Vitas of
                  saints that are translations and that are narrative.</p>

                  <p>If we are compiling just a short description of the manuscript without
                     information about each text, the most convenient method is to use just a
                     paragraph with short information:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                        <p>The Aprakos Evangelion is without beginning and end. It starts with the
                           reading for the Saturday of the 3rd week after Lent (Mk 8:30-31),
                           continues with the Sunday after the 4th week of the Lent (Mk 9:17), and
                           then the reading for the Saturday of the 5th week after Lent follows.
                           After that there are texts for Palm Sunday and for the Monday and Tuesday

                  <p>For more elaborate cataloguing purposes it is necessary to use special elements
                     to describe the textual characteristics of the manuscript content in full.
                     These elements are:</p>

               <p>A summary should contain a brief phrase characterizing in some way the collection

               <p>This summary could also contain data about the quantity of the text in the
                  manuscript, e.g.:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <p>This is a very rare tradition in medieval manuscripts, and is more common in early

                  to give a link to the image of the page:

               <head>The authors, editors and compilers of the text collection in the
                  manuscript</head>
               <p>In most cases manuscripts contain texts from different authors and their tradition
                  of edition and compilation could be very variable. There are, however, also
                  codices that contain more or less a fixed collection of texts by or attributed to
                  a single author. In such cases, such as the Pandects of Antiochus, Pandects of
                  Nikon of Montenegro or Chrysorrhoas collection with writings of John Chrysostom
                  (Thomson 1982; Miltenov 2010; Милтенов 2011) we can provide information about the
                  author and sometimes about the editor/compiler of the whole set of texts, as in
                  this example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <author>John Chrysostom</author>
                  <respStmt>
                     <resp>Translator</resp>
                     <name>monk Antonij</name>
                  </respStmt>
                  <respStmt>
                     <resp>Compiler</resp>
                     <name>Vladislav Grammatik</name>
                  </respStmt> From the electronic description of MS Rila 3/6 by Anisava Miltenova </egXML></p>
               <p>Here we have three kinds of information: 1) about the original author of the texts
                  (John Chrysostom), 2) about the translator of his works (monk Antonij), and 3)
                  about the compiler of this miscellany (Vladislav Gramatik). All the information
                  other than authorship is contained in the element <gi>respStmt</gi>, which has two
                  parts: (1)<gi>resp</gi> (responsibility), here a brief statement in the form of
                  words as <code>editor</code>, <code>compiler</code>, <code>scribe</code>, etc.,
                  could be made, and (2) information about the person in elements <gi>name</gi> or
                     <gi>persName</gi> (personal name, cf. Burnard and Bauman 2007:
                     <gi>respStmt</gi>).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>A note in the description of texts</head>
               <p>The element <gi>note</gi> in the description of texts is restricted to cases that
                  deal with extra-textual historical features, such as missing parts of the texts:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <note>Most of the texts have some missing parts. Cf. Manuscript Condition </note>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>Here, a reference to the physical condition of the manuscript is given. In other
                  cases the element <gi>note</gi> could be useful to further refine the text
                  attribution of the whole codex and/or to provide bibliographic data:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <note>Sprostranov was the first to attribute the whole collection to the single

            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Information about text history for the whole manuscript</head>
               <p>The text historical information on the level of the whole manuscripts is part of
                  the content of the series of element <gi>filiation</gi>. This element has one
                  important attribute, <att>type</att>, the most common values of which are :</p>
               <p><val>antigraph</val>: information about the text collection’s antigraph</p>
               <p><val>apograph</val>: information about the text collection’s apograph</p>
               <p><val>litRedaction</val>: information about the textual redaction or recension of
                  the whole manuscript</p>
               <p><val>protograph</val>: information about the text collection’s protograph</p>
               <p><val>source</val>: the source of the whole text collection</p>
               <p><val>translation:</val> data about the translation with respect to number and/or
                  origin.</p>
               <p>Examples of usage are given below. On the level of the whole manuscript these
                  features are invoked only when conclusions can be drawn for the whole text
                  collection about a common source, protograph, literary redaction, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The original text on the level of the whole manuscript</head>
               <p>Some collections of texts have a common title or heading, incipit and explicit. In
                  this cases, the element <gi>sampleText</gi> could be used. In all other cases the
                  element <gi>sampleText</gi> should be used to illustrate particular texts from the
                  manuscripts, rather than the whole body of the codex.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The characterization of each text</head>
               <p>Information about each individual text resembles closely the description of the
                  whole text collection. All features of such a description are given as part of the
                  element <gi>msItemStruct</gi> (a structured manuscript item, Burnard and Bauman
                  2007: msItemStruct). This element has the same three attributes, with the same
                  functions, as <gi>msContents</gi>: <att>type</att>, <att>style</att> and
                     <att>class</att>. In addition to these attributes it may be convenient to use
                  unique identifier for each text as part of the XML document (attribute
                     <att>xml:id</att>), as well as perhaps <att>defective</att> with one of the
                  values: <val>true</val>, <val>false</val>, <val>unknown</val>,
                     <val>inapplicable</val>. In the Repertorium framework the value of the
                     <att>xml:id</att> in <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is a combination of the fixed string
                     <val>ACD</val> (abbreviation for <code>Article Content Description</code>) and
                  the place number of the text in order in the manuscript. A combination of all of
                  the important attributes of <gi>msItemStruct</gi> can be illustrated by this
                  hypothetical example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct defective="false" type="compilation" style="non-narrative" xml:id="ACD1">
                     … 
                  </msItemStruct>
               </egXML></p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The text location</head>
               <p>The exact place of the text in the manuscript is given as part of the element
                     <gi>locus</gi>. In the Repertorium we use this element together with the
                  attribute <att>n</att> (number) to represent the number of a text as part of a
                  whole text collection:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <locus n="1">1r-25v</locus>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>The contents of the element here is the exact ordinal location in the manuscript
                  where the text is to be found.</p>
               <p>When the one and same text is dispersed across different parts of manuscript a
                     <gi>locusGrp</gi> element is used, as in this example from the electronic
                  description of MS NBKM 309 by Anisava Miltenova:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <locusGrp n="7">

                     <locus n="7.2">90r-90v</locus>

               <p>In this example the text is falsely reordered in two different places in the
                  manuscript, so that the beginning part of the text is bound after the ending part.
                  In such cases it is mandatory to give the exact order of the leaves. The attribute
                     <att>n</att> gives here the exact number of the text (7), which is restored to
                  logical order with the help of sub-numbers (7.1 and 7.2).</p>

               <head>The name of the text given by the researcher</head>
               <p>In the approach of Repertorium Initiative, there is a strict distinction between
                  text supplied by the researcher (the so-called “scientific title" or "supplied
                  title") and the original title of a text as it appears in the manuscript copy.
                  Both are important, the original text because it is part of the archaeographic
                  object and the scientific title because it enables researchers to identify and
                  attribute texts consistently, even when the titles may be spelled differently in
                  different manuscripts.</p>
               <p>Consider the following example:

               <p>If the title were just transferred automatically from the original text of the
                  manuscript, the text would read “About the 12 Apostles. Where each of them
                  preached". Such a title would not make it possible to identify other copies of the
                  same text, where the heading in those other manuscripts will probably be
                  different, and it would also not be possible to compare this text with its Greek
                  source. In this case the element <gi>title</gi> should provide a standardized
                  title that is compatible with other Slavonic and non-Slavonic traditions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The author of the text</head>

                  included in the manuscript itself. The usage of this element and as well as the
                  element <gi>respStmt</gi> is exactly as the illustrated as part of the element

               <p>In this example, the element’s content explains the title given by the researcher.
                  Without the knowledge that this fragment is part of a larger text, which has its
                  own tradition, it would be impossible to undertake further steps in the
                  investigation. This element may also be used to explain text losses and

                  we could enter fixed or movable dates presented in the manuscript copy or known by

                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <title xml:lang="en">Vita of John the Hesychast</title>

               <p>Here we have all possible information about this date in the
                  <title level="m">Codex
                     Suprasliensis</title>. The
                  commemoration of St. John the Hesychast in this manuscript is on March 31,
                  formalized as <code>03-31</code>. The date is used in the church calendar
                     (<code>type="church"</code>), it is presented in the manuscript (internal,
                  i.e., not supplied or conjectured by the encoder) and is part of the

               <head>The language of the text</head>
               <p>Unlike the element <gi>scribeLang</gi>, which is intended to give information
                  about the language of the scribe and of the manuscript parts, <gi>textLang</gi>
                  can provide material for the linguistic analysis of the textological features of a
                  particular text.</p>
               <p>Consider the example:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <textLang>Only in this text we could find the older forms of the stemmatic

               </egXML></p>
               <p>This observation could lead to closer comparison of this text with other parts of
                  the contents, and may help determine whether its origin is different from
                  theirs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The text source</head>
               <p>Usually the source in the Slavonic tradition is a Greek or Latin original text
                  that served as the source of translation. In the example above the excerpt:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <filiation type="source" subtype="Greek"><bibl>Migne, PG 10, col.
                     952-953</bibl></filiation>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>does not mean that the given text is a direct source for the translation, but that
                  it is cited as a parallel to the Slavic text in the described manuscript.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The text translation</head>
               <p>If the text is translated from other sources, then in the element
                     <gi>filiation</gi> with the attribute <att>type</att> bearing value
                     <val>translation</val> the encoder may enter information about the translation,
                  e.g., the number of the translation and the place. A question mark can be used to
                  indicate uncertainty, e.g.:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               <head>Special parts for textual criticism</head>
               <p>As with the description of the whole manuscript content, at least four values
                  could be given for <att>type</att> in the element <gi>filiation</gi>:
                     <val>protograph</val>, <val>antigraph</val>, <val>apograph</val>, and
                     <val>litRedaction</val>. These elements can provide a context for researching
                  the transmission of the text by situating it within the larger tradition. Here is
                  an example from the electronic description of the <hi rend="italic">Manuilev
                     Apostle</hi> by Margaret Dimitrova, Andrej Bojadžiev, and Elisaveta Moussakova:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <filiation type="litRedaction">The manuscript uses archaic lexis and is considered
                     to belong to the archaic group of Apostoloi representing the Cyrillo-Methodian

                     112</ref></bibl></filiation></egXML></p>
               <p>A combination of several <gi>filiation</gi> elements with different values of
                     <att>type</att> can specify the exact place of a text copy, as in this example:

               <head>The text location and textual criticism</head>
               <p>A comparison of different copies of one and the same text may lead to interesting
                  results. For example MS NBKM 309 and MS Slav. Dujčev 17 share almost the same
                  content, the latter manuscript being the copy of the former. During restoration
                  the content of the MS NBKM 309 was rearranged, leading to disordered folia. As a
                  result the content of both is now best described by comparison (Милтенова 1989).
                  In the process of electronic cataloguing the contents of the both manuscripts have
                  been reconstructed as part of the process of identifying a possible common
                  ancestor. In electronic form this task could be fulfilled by attribute values in
                  elements <gi>msItemStruct</gi> and <gi>locus</gi>. In both manuscript descriptions
                     <att>xml:id</att> begins with value <val>ACD1</val>. However, the values of the
                  attribute <att>n</att> on the element <gi>locus</gi> differ. The first text in MS
                  NBKM 309 is:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD1" type="translation">

               </egXML></p>
               <p>The same text in the description of Slav Dujčev 17 has the same number in
                     <gi>locus</gi> but comes in the second place:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD2" type="translation">

                     <title>Calendologion</title> … </msItemStruct>
               </egXML></p>
               <p>One text is missing in MS NBKM 309 but it is present in Dujčev 17, where it bears
                  a designation number 2:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <msItemStruct xml:id="ACD1" type="translation">

               <p>In both manuscripts the first item from the reconstructed cycle is missing, and
                  therefore an element <gi>locus</gi> with <code>n="1"</code> is absent as well.</p>
               <p>Thus, we can have three different points of view about the place of a particular
                  text: 1) as part of the manuscript; 2) as part of the content shared with another
                  manuscript, and 3) as part of the reconstructed cycle of texts.</p>

                     <gi>decoDesc</gi> and with the same XML content as <gi>msItemStruct</gi>. This
                  could be especially convenient in cases when the manuscript copy is compared with
                  other copies of the same text, which could lead to conclusions about specific text
                  formation and layout.</p>

                  <p>The Repertorium uses a special element <gi>sampleText</gi> as a wrapper around
                     several elements used for the identification of text items in a manuscript. Its
                     function is to make a distinction between the language of the description
                     (metadata used to describe the manuscript) and the original text. The element
                     itself uses one global TEI attribute, <att>xml:lang</att>, which represents the
                     language of the content, and for medieval Slavonic codices its value is almost
                     always <val>cu</val>. The optional attribute <att>script</att> commonly
                     contains the value <val>Cyrs</val>(for old Cyrillic) or <val>Glag</val> (for
                     Glagolitic). The following example is from the electronic description of MS

                  <head>Samples from the original text of the manuscript</head>
                  <p>In some older catalogues there is a special section that contains a sample of
                     the manuscript text. When creating an electronic version of such materials,
                        <gi>sampleText</gi> is an convenient way to preserved these text

                  <p>In some manuscripts there may be texts that are rare or perhaps completely
                     unknown to researchers, and the edition of such texts in the description of a
                     manuscript could serve as a preliminary publication. In such cases an element
                        <gi>div</gi> (division, Burnard and Bauman 2007: div) should be used with an
                     appropriate value in the attribute <att>xml:lang</att>.</p>

                  <p>Other parts of the description might also include examples and citations from
                     the manuscript source. These could be entered in two ways:</p>
                  <list rend="numbered">
                     <item>As part of the content of the element <gi>foreign</gi> with an
                        appropriate value in element <att>xml:lang</att>. In this case
                           <gi>foreign</gi> means in a different language in comparison to the rest
                        of the text.</item>
                     <item>As part of a linguistic segmentation model. In the TEI framework it is
                        possible to choose among the elements <gi>c</gi> (character), <gi>cl</gi>
                        (grammatical clause), <gi>m</gi> (grammatical morpheme), <gi>pc</gi>

                           <code>model.segLike</code>. As with the elements <gi>sampleText</gi> and
                           <gi>foreign</gi>, these should all have attribute <att>xml:lang</att>
                        with the corresponding value.</item>

               <p>The last element in the content of <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is for bibliographic
                  references, which are restricted to the attribution of text and its edition. They
                  come in two variants: 1) one bibliographic reference in the element <gi>bibl</gi>,
                  or 2) a list of more than one reference (element <gi>listBibl</gi>). In the
                  framework of the Repertorium project all bibliographic references for all
                  manuscript descriptions are gathered in one place, and the XML files that contain
                  the descriptions of the individual manuscript hold only pointers to these external
                  reference lists. These pointers could look like the following:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <bibl><ref target="../bibliography/i.xml#IvanovJ1932">Иванов 1932</ref></bibl>

               <head>Description of texts with complicated structure</head>
               <p>There are many texts in the medieval tradition that are composed, in turn, from
                  other texts or text parts, and the Repertorium model, building on TEI, provides a
                  method for describing such texts as part of the larger ones. This task could be
                  accomplished by nesting <gi>msItemStruct</gi> inside another <gi>msItemStruct</gi>
                  element, as in the following example from the electronic description of MS Pant.

               <p>The location of the manuscript date and place in the description differs across
                  descriptive models. The deviations are caused not by the particular research
                  culture (e.g., Byzantine Greek, Slavonic, Latin, Armenian, Georgian, or Hebrew),
                  but, rather, by the more general assumptions of local traditions. Very often the
                  date of a manuscript is represented as part of the heading of the description,
                  together with the place of origin and its name. In the Repertorium framework
                  historical information about a manuscript is unified within the element

            <list>
               <item>administrative information about the description and manuscript custody</item>
               <item>facts about copies of the manuscript</item>

               <head>Administrative information</head>
               <p>The administrative information in this model consists of a recording of changes in
                  the electronic description (<gi>recordHist</gi>), a statement of the manuscript’s
                  availability (<gi>availability</gi>), a sketch of custodial events
                     (<gi>custodialHist</gi>), and optional extra or complementary data
                     (<gi>note</gi>).</p>
               <div>
                  <head>Recording the history of the electronic description</head>
                  <p>The element <gi>recordHist</gi> can be used to document all changes in the
                     electronic description. In this element, as elsewhere in the TEI, the encoder
                     has two ways to submit data – as one or more paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) or as a
                     sequence of specialized elements, which in this case are <gi>source</gi> and
                        <gi>change</gi>. The <gi>source</gi> is not repeatable, but because there
                     could be many changes in the electronic description, <gi>change</gi> is
                     optional and repeatable. For example:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <recordHist>
                        <source>Derived from the second volume of Benjo Tsonev’s description of

                        <change when="2012-02-02"><name>Andrej Bojadžiev</name> changed the

                  <head>Availability of the manuscript</head>
                  <p>Unlike the element <gi>availability</gi> as part of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> (cf.
                     below), the appearance of this element in the context of administrative
                     information refers to the availability of the manuscript itself. In most of the
                     cases access to the archival collection is restricted, which is reflected in an
                     entry like the following:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                     <availability>
                        <p>Restricted. Used by permission and by appointment with the curator</p>
                     </availability>
                  </egXML></p>
                  <p>The encoder might wish to consult the archive itself for the appropriate
                     formulation of rules for access to the manuscript.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Custodial facts</head>
                  <p>Here too, the encoder has two ways to submit data – as one or more paragraphs
                        (<gi>p</gi>) or as one or more <gi>custEvent</gi> (custodial event, Burnard
                     and Bauman 2007) elements. This element might include facts about restoration,
                     conservation of the manuscript, participation in exhibitions, etc., e.g.:
                     <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <p>Every event in the history of the manuscript can be encoded as a separate
                        <gi>custEvent</gi> element containing the attribute <att>type</att>, which
                     further specifies its kind. The attributes <att>from</att> and <att>to</att>
                     give information about the date span.</p>

            <p>The element <gi>msPart</gi> (i.e. manuscript part) should be used in the cases when
               the manuscript is a) a convolute; b) a palimpsest, c) a supplemental physically
               different part in the manuscript or d) a supplemental and additionally written
               literary part of the manuscript. Several cases can be distinguished:</p>
            <list rend="simple">
               <item>When the codex is re-bound and later end leaves and paste-downs are inserted by
                  the rebinding process this information should be entered in the corresponding
                  sections of the element <gi>binding</gi>;</item>
               <item>The same is true in cases when the parchment or paper is reinforced as part of
                  the rebinding process.</item>
               <item>However, when a later leaf or leaves is inserted in order to supplement the
                  text and this part is obviously different, the element <gi>msPart</gi> should be
                  used to describe the codicological, palaeographic, language and text features of
                  this inserted part.</item>
               <item>The element <gi>msPart</gi> is not used to distinguish parts of the text
                  written by the particular scribes. This information is part of the element
                     <gi>scribe</gi> and its sub-elements.</item>
               <item>The element <gi>msPart</gi> is not used when the manuscript is currently kept
                  in various repositories or in one repository under different shelfmarks. This
                  information is entered in element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and its sub-element
                     <gi>altIdentifier</gi>.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The element <gi>msPart</gi> consists of the same elements for identification and the
               description of physical features, language, palaeography and text as mentioned above
               for an entire manuscript.</p>
            <p>The identification part has several variants:</p>
            <list rend="numbered">
               <item>With the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi> – usage should be restricted to cases
                  where the physically different part of the manuscript is kept in another
                  repository or within the same repository but under a different shelfmark.</item>
               <item>With the element <gi>altIdentifier</gi> – could be used to mention a special
                  name of the manuscript part, e.g., in the case of palimpsests.</item>
               <item>The most obvious and convenient way to describe physically distinct part of the
                  manuscript is to use the elements <gi>locus</gi> and <gi>locusGrp</gi>.</item>

               <p>Somewhere at the beginning of the physical description should be a short statement
                  about the fact that the manuscript in question is a palimpsest. Sections about
                  manuscript cataloguing, history, etc. are almost always common for all data with
                  one exception: the original dates of writing and places of origin differ, and this
                  information should be provided explicitly. In cases involving restoration and
                  references there could be a need for additional data sets. Parts are further
                  specified with the help of <att>type</att>.</p>

               <p>From the point of view of electronic encoding there is not much difference between
                  palimpsests and convolutes, even though, unlike palimpsests, convolutes can be
                  formed from paper and are defined not in terms of layers, but as a horizontal
                  sequence of parts. For example:

               <p>In principle, convolutes do not require special manuscript names or shelfmarks.
                  They do, however, require a special section pointing to the place(s) where the
                  parts are to be found. In the example above the element <gi>locus</gi> fulfills
                  this role.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Description of additional folia or parts of the manuscripts</head>
               <p>The use of the <gi>msPart</gi> element might be appropriate when there are
                  additional parts in the manuscript that are not to be considered as convoluted, or
                  do not form a part of binding (paste-downs or end-leaves), and which might
                  intersect with the provenance of the manuscript. Such parts should be described as
                  separate element <gi>msPart</gi> with the value of the attribute <att>type</att>
                  additional:

               <p>Examples of such usage could include an additional note on a separate leaf, or
                  text from a later scribe.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Additionally written part(s) of a manuscript</head>
               <p>A special case could be a separate text written on the same folia as the original
                  manuscript but containing an entire separate literary work. This addition is best
                  described inside a special <gi>msPart</gi> element with its own location, name of
                  the scribe, if available, and, of course, with a description of the content. Very
                  often these texts are unique in the tradition and they deserve a special edition
                  inside the description. In such cases an element <gi>div</gi> with its
                  sub-elements should be provided, as in the following example:

               <p>One particularly complicated case for description is a Sinai Slavic Miscellany
                  that now is kept in two libraries, where it is divided into 5 parts. The
                  manuscript, written on parchment and paper, has palimpsest parts in Cyrillic,
                  Glagolitic and Greek. The description begins with the heading:

               <p>Since the texts now are in different repositories, their sequence and locations

               <p>The first part of the TEI file contains the <gi>titleStmt</gi> (i.e., title
                  statement), which unifies information about the document title (<gi>title</gi>)
                  and creators . In this example there are three types of creators: author, editor
                  and the person who edited the XML code. Each of these creators is identified by
                  the value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute.</p>

               <p>The second type of information deals with the publication of the document. It
                  includes the name of the publisher, place and date of publishing, internal
                  Repertorium identifier and availability (available, restricted, etc.). A sample of
                  such information could look as follows:

               <head>The source of the document</head>
               <p>The last part of the <gi>fileDesc</gi> element deals with sources. In the case of
                  a manuscript description that is intended to serve as the sole content of the
                  electronic file, this information may be very brief. A thorough explanation of the
                  sources for the description could then be part of the <gi>recordHist</gi> element
                  in the administrative part of the file (<gi>adminInfo</gi> ). A short example of a
                  bibliographic reference could be:
                  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               </egXML></p>
               <p>If, however, the description is to be accompanied by an edition of the manuscript
                  text, then the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> should contain all elements of the description,
                  beginning with the <gi>msDesc</gi>. In that case the edited text of the manuscript
                  would constitute the body of the document:

               <p>The creation (date and place) information is for internal usage. The form of the
                  date as part of the attribute is given as the sequence <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>
                  (year-month-day). Most of the files in the Repertorium are in Bulgarian, English
                  and Old Bulgarian (Old Slavic, Old Church Slavonic). Latin is also used widely,
                  especially in some manuscript names, e.g., Codex Zographensis. In this place in
                  the description it is encoded as:

                  Each change is documented separately, starting with the most recent, e.g.:

               <p>Here the value of the attribute <att>who</att> points to one of the content
                  creators identified elsewhere. The date in the attribute is in year-month-day
                  format. This list of revisions is intended to reflect primarily the technical side
                  of the document. The documentation of editorial changes of a manuscript
                  description might more properly be encoded in the <gi>recordHist</gi> as part of
                  the administrative information (<gi>adminInfo</gi>).</p>

            <div>
               <head>Divisions</head>
               <p>In the TEI approach there are two ways to structure a given text at a high level:
                  numbered and unnumbered text divisions. The Repertorium uses only the latter
                  approach. In the description of manuscripts in the Repertorium project the element
                     <gi>div</gi> is used only in cases when an unknown or rare text or text variant
                  is discovered and merits inclusion as a preliminary edition.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Paragraphs</head>
               <p>Paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) may appear in various places in the
                  description—essentially anywhere where there is not enough data for a structured
                  description or where such a description is otherwise unnecessary or undesirable. A
                  possible example might be paragraphs in the element <gi>condition</gi>, where
                  different types of damage or loss could be grouped together, as in this example
                  from the description of <title level="m">Codex Suprasliensis</title>:

                  Both elements are described in TEI Guidelines (Burnard and Bauman 2007). In the
                  Repertorium framework neither of these should contain a full bibliographical
                  record; Repertorium practice is that these elements contain only pointers to full
                  bibliographic information, which is encoded at the end of a description or, when
                  the description is part of the larger project, in а separate file.</p>

            <p>The Repertorium Initiative provides detailed, structured additions to the TEI XML
               manuscript description model. It complements the TEI model in some parts through the
               rearrangement of known elements, the addition of new ones, and the extension of the
               base of specialized attributes, all with an eye toward intra-project consistency and
               support for particular details of the Slavonic philological tradition.</p>
